``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Ariel, a few days after Christmas.

``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?  I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor, in
soft light from an electric candle on my windowsill.  I'd just finished a
workout and my body felt good.  I took a picture of myself, and sent it to
Ariel.  He laughed.

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale,'' he said. ``Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind
it.''

``No, I get it,'' I said. ``You should do it.''

On January 18th, I flew to Seattle for a software engineering interview at
Amazon.  When I got to my hotel, I sat outside in the dark and worked on some
coding problems.

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking another class to increase the chances of being able to
go to state school,'' said Ariel.  ``How do you feel about writing a few papers
and blog posts?  For ... \$1k?  Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do
you want to pursue this?''

I knew I wouldn't have enough time.  My last semester at Cornell was going to be
hard, like all the other semesters.

But, it was going to be hard no matter what.  After five years of trying to
become a beautiful, strong student, I was starting to accept that a cycle of
time debt, hypomania, and failure was probably natural.

``Sure, I'll do it,'' I texted Ariel.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up feeling intuitively sad, and walked to the Amazon
campus.  About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split into
groups of three, and given laptops.  I tried to be social with the other
interviewees.

As we booted our machines, a proctor gave each group a laminated booklet
detailing a programming problem.

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``You'll each submit your own code to the repository.''

As the room went silent, I began to feel a blind, helpless rage.  The interview
format was absurd, and I imagined myself walking out.  I wondered what the
consequences of that would be.

After I finished indulging these thoughts, I took a few deep breaths, and
started to read the problem booklet.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Exiting the interview site, I fell in with a group of the more confident, social
interviewees, and we went to an atmospheric Asian restaurant in Belltown.

A guy from McGill, Ihsan, was showing me his mobile-optimized graphics engine.

``It's really close to the metal.  To optimize for mobile, I had to directly
open up buffers for matrix operations.  Cool stuff.''

A waitress brought us warm saki and sashimi, and we talked about our other
interviews at good tech companies.

I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror after peeing.

Another guy, also from Cornell, told us about his genius boss at Palantir.  They
had done acid together, at work.

``That's terrifying,'' I said, picturing Palantir's glossy black office in
Chelsea.  I rested my face on my hand, thinking of Chelsea Manning alone in
Iraq.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After dinner, we went to a legal recreational marijuana shop, the first and only
in Oregon.  The cab driver knew exactly where we wanted to go.  We left the shop
feeling giddy.

The cab took us to a park near our hotel.  As I finished my pre-rolled joint, I
realized I was pretty high, but not paranoid or dysphoric.   The other guys were
very high.

Ihsan started talking about how he thought he might not die, because of
computers.  The Taiwanese guy laughed manically and I smiled, listening to the
wind in the leaves above.

We hesitantly talked about the future of computing, referencing the imminent
possibility of our employment at Amazon.  I imagined the glossy apartment I
would live in, and how I could work with these guys on weekends, developing some
sort of game engine.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up early for a jog.  I ran downhill, wearing a
sweatshirt that I didn't need.

At the harbor, the horizon seemed close.  I walked along the boardwalk and
watched bubbles well up in the green water, thinking about the programmers at
Microsoft.

I took a picture and sent it to my mom.  I thought for a moment, and said
something about the legal marijuana shop before I could stop myself.

I started to jog again.  The interview had gone well.  Assuming I got an offer
from Amazon, Seattle would be a decent place to live.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

It was bitterly cold back in Ithaca.

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.
I felt hopeful and clear-headed after, showering with my teammates.  My back
muscles relaxed under the hot water.

When I returned to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  ``Thanks From Amazon'' was the
subject, a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively.

I threw my phone onto a stack of clothes and started to get dressed.  I'm
totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't make sense.
Unbelievable.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

A few hours later in human-robotics interaction class, the professor told us to find a
partner.  We were given five minutes to build a tower out of spaghetti, string,
marshmallows, and tape.  It was a competition.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She had a blemished
face and seemed to be almost thirty.

We tried to come up with a plan, but at some point we just started to build. We
ended up with a tower that was probably the second tallest in the classroom,
until it broke at the last second.

We joked uneasily, but it was obvious that we secretly blamed each other for our
broken tower and took this sort of thing seriously.

The professor told us that besides groups of engineers, kindergarteners
typically built the tallest towers.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Saturday night, there was a snowstorm.  I went to the library and checked out
``Dangling Man'' by Saul Bellow, the first book for Ariel's class.

The main character did all of the unlikable, confrontational things I did in my
bad dreams, where I screamed at all of the people in my life, my parents, my
coaches, my teammates.  In these dreams I often quit rowing, saying that I never
really liked it anyways, and then felt a deep, lucid regret until my alarm
went off.

I told myself that rowing was the most important thing.  The early winter
workouts were long, but not particularly stressful or painful.

I was getting a pretty consistent 6.5 hours of sleep.  Every day I visualized
finishing my last race and lying down in the boat.

``I'm going to need a lot more attention, love, and respect!'' I wrote in my
notebook.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Valentine's Day we did the `massacre', a 10k erg followed by a 3 mile run.
As in previous years, it wasn't too bad.  In the cold, I could find a consistent
level of pain.

After getting home and spending a few hours in bed, I went to dinner with my
partner from human-robotics interaction.  Her name was Allison.

As we sat down at our table, a group of upperclassmen rowers came in with girls.
I nodded at them over Allison's shoulder.

I was happy that we'd picked the same restaurant.  I was proud of how civilized
my teammates looked and acted, much better than most Cornell undergraduates, who
seemed to lack a critical sense of \textit{noblesse oblige}.

Allison and I talked about our first assignment, building a robot out of
cardboard.  Allison told me that she worked at a grocery store and had access to
leftover packaging.

``Great,'' I said.

After dinner, Allison asked me about my post-grad plans.

``I'm not exactly sure yet,'' I said.  ``Probably Amazon, if I'm willing to move
out there.''

``Cool,'' said Allison, nodding.  ``I think that's where I'm going, too.''

``Amazon?  Or the west coast.''

``The west coast.  Facebook Research.''

``Awesome,'' I said.  ``Working on what?''

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The new Drake album came out and practices were getting harder.

I was having trouble pushing myself.  I remembered the broken, fast feeling of
being twenty, the cold adrenaline trickling down my spine in the middle of a
piece.  At that time I would embrace it, despite the urge to look for a way out.

I needed to go back to that, when I was depressed but felt good because I was
getting faster.

Now some part of me just wanted it to be over, for someone to call it off,
cancel the race.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On the last Saturday before dry season, I drove a group of people up to the
rowing house on North Campus.

I clasped hands with Tom at the door.  He introduced me to my date from
Tri-Delt, who asked me how drunk I wanted to get on a scale of one to ten. I
said eight.  She said eight was a good number, and we did shots.

After dinner, other people started showing up.  My date and I stuck together,
wandering around the crowded house.  It was a nice change from how I normally
felt at rowing parties: ignored by non-rowers, and darkly motivated to train
harder, so I'd get more respect from my teammates.

When it started snowing around midnight, we went outside along with almost
everyone else.  Freshmen rowers from both teams were naked, running around the
house.

I put my arm around my date, feeling validated by the beauty of the moment.  I
made sure to appreciate the long, straight country road on the opposite side of
Lake Cayuga, and the suggestive condensation on the windows of the house.  I'd
felt this many times.

We went to the tree line and made out.  Her saliva had a strong, unsurprising
taste.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Back inside, we followed an injured lightweight rower upstairs to do lines of
coke off of a photocopier.  I thought of my ex-girlfriend.

Later in the night, someone shattered a heavy glass beer boot across the brick
dancefloor.

``Woah, woah, woah,'' yelled Alex, pushing my date and I away from the glass.
An Asian guy in Vineyard Vines was standing at the door, staring
expressionlessly at Tom.

``You're a fucking pussy,'' said Tom, smiling.  I moved to follow them outside,
but Alex pushed me back.

``Yo, everyone fucking chill, remember plausible fucking deniability.''

Tom came back in a few minutes later, covered in snow and bleeding from his eye.
He exchanged a few words with the commodore of the team, and then let us help
him.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

My date and I agreed to leave when the house was almost empty.  We silently
walked across the suspension bridge to Collegetown, bracing against the wind.  I
couldn't think of anything to say.

My date shared a suite with three other women from Tri-Delt, who were still up.
In her room, we independently took our clothes off and starting kissing on the
bed.  She got up and turned off the light.

``I can't see,'' I said.

We kept kissing, and I took off her bra.  It was my first time hooking up with
someone from a rowing party.  We moved our hands downwards and I started
fingering her, listening to her breathe.  Time passed.

``Pat, stop,'' she said.

``What?'' I said.

``You're not hard, Pat,'' she said.  Her hand was on my dick.  I stared down at
her eyes, glowing softly in the dark.  I started to kiss her again.

``Stop, you're not even hard,'' she said.

I stopped, still on top of her.

``Pat...'' she said.

``You're so gay, Pat,'' she said.  ``It's okay, my best friend is gay.''

``No, I'm not,'' I said, after a few seconds.

``Oh my god, yes you are.  You're so gay.  You like Tom, right?''

``What?  I'm not gay,'' I said.

``Okay, bi, then?  I can tell you like Tom.  It's okay.''

``I don't know,'' I said.  ``No,'' I said.

I got off of her, and stared up at the ceiling.  She went out into the hall for
a moment, and then told me to get dressed.  I started to feel distantly upset.

She walked me to the door, telling me that she adored me.  I apologized.  I
heard her saying ``oh my god'' to her suitemates as the door closed.

I stalked home, blind drunk.  I let my body go slack against the wind and
snowflakes.  Back in my room, I realized that I'd left my watch at her place.  I
wouldn't be able to ask for it back.  I let out a noise and punched the wall.

I hated that watch anyways, I told myself.  My grandfather had pressured me into
spending \$500 on it.   I sat down at my computer and wrote into a Google doc
while facebook messaging an Internet person, both mostly in all-caps.  Then I
put myself to sleep.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up without a hangover, and jogged to North Campus to get
my car.  It was time to change my life.

The first assignment for Ariel's class was due on Monday.  I wrote the first
third of the essay before noon, developing a thesis around Joseph's doomed
rejection of the `code of the athlete'.

I went to a dining hall for lunch, and worked on my scalable systems assignment
for a while.  Then, I thought about what I wanted in life.

It seemed like what I wanted most \textit{directly} was a brand-name job at a
company like Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Goldman Sachs.  I wanted the feeling
of success that would come with such a job, and the six-figure salary.

I continued this line of thought during yoga.

It would be the easiest way to fix my life.  I knew it probably wouldn't
\textit{actually} fix my life.  But from my parent's perspective, from everyone
else's perspective, it would.

I wanted it more than I wanted the dismal, self-delusional success that I might
find in game development or writing.  I wanted it in the pure way I wanted to
hook up with hot, normal college students; for the same reason that Ariel
wanted to go to state school.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Tom and Seth walked over to me during the warm-up for Monday morning lift.  It
was obvious they knew about the `not hard' thing.

``Yo, Steadman, how was it with uh, Jennifer?  She was all over you,'' said
Seth.

``I don't even know, man,'' I said.

``She like, told us you said you were bi?  What?  I was like Steadman?
No.''

``Yeah, noo,'' I said. ``I was really fucked up, I have no idea what I said.''

We stopped talking while the weight room coach went over the max squat test
procedure.  ``Born To Run'' came on, and Seth elbowed me.

During my first few months on the team, I had experienced a constant sense that
my teammates were calling me `scrub' or `bitch' behind my back.  I felt that if
I ever revealed my `true self' to them, it would be like intentionally killing
an ally in a video game, and being instantly attacked from all sides.

It felt good to remind myself that I wasn't worried about this sort of thing
anymore.  Rowing was above that.

The squat test was my bread and butter, and I did well.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

I stayed up late to finish Ariel's essay, mostly procrastinating before I
finally focused at 3:30AM.

This messed up the rest of the week.

I emailed coach to tell him I had a fever and wouldn't be at practice, and then
met Allison at the robot lab to merge our teleoperation code.   Allison's code
was non-functional overall, but included a bit of linear algebra that corrected
an issue I had with negative rotations for the robot's arm.

Around 1AM we walked home together, both shivering hard.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Things were always better when I was in control of my behavior.

On Saturday morning, bright sunlight filled the boathouse during erg bracket
racing.  My quads felt large and hammy.  I told myself it was time to get fast
and spend all of my time with rowers.

That evening, I went to Collegetown Bagels.  It was full of drunk people.  I
felt sexually frustrated, but mostly tired.

A bored, injured rower came over later that evening.  He smoked weed and watched
me install `Deus Ex', PC Gamer's game of the year in 2001.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

For my twenty-third birthday, my parents took me out to dinner at the hotel
school restaurant.  I told them I was evaluating the Amazon offer, but was
looking for other options.

I felt sick and nervous during the week leading up to our first 2k test, but it
went well.  I went into the pain cave at the right time, with about eight
hundred meters to go.

The post-2k evening was wonderful, as always.  Some girls from Arts and Sciences
came over, and we played records on our record player.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

During the week before spring break, the inlet was still full of ice.  We had to
drive twenty minutes up the lake to practice on the cold, heavy water.

On Thursday evening, it was still light out when we were told to head in.  I was
anxious to get back to campus, but our coxswain missed the makeshift dock, and
we were blown into shore.  We had to get out of the boat and wade it in,
slipping over the rocky beach.

After helping tie down the boat, I sat on Max's bumper and shook seashells out
of my loafers.  It had been another absurd practice.  I'd spent most of it with
my free hand tucked under my balls, listening to Coach talk about how winning
would change us.

Back on campus, I got two Rockstar energy drinks and went to the Computer
Science Undergraduate Lounge.  My advanced game development group was waiting
for me.  We worked through the night, trying to isolate a three hundred megabyte
memory leak.  As we presented to the professor the next morning, I started to
feel a tightness in my throat.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After a few hours of sleep, I went to Teagle Hall for practice, preparing myself
for the worst.  We were pleasantly surprised by a sunset jog through the
plantations.  I relaxed my face, slipping into the grainy fatigue.

I went to Gannett the next day, feeling awful.  It was quiet, the first day of
spring break.  They did a blood test, and told me I had pneumonia.

I went to 7/11 and got as much food and beer as I could carry home.

For three days, I did nothing but drink and play `Deus Ex'.  My sickness got
pretty bad, requiring me to go to the bathroom to cough up bile.  I felt guilty
about not being at practice, but it was okay.

I discovered that when I drank alcohol in `Deus Ex', a blur filter was applied
to the display, the effect stacking with each drink.  The 2001-era graphics
seemed impossibly beautiful to me, late at night, with my space heater at my
feet.  It was sometimes almost impossible to tell what I was doing, in the dark
underground areas of the game, or stumbling around my basement apartment,
coughing.

It was one of the happiest times I had in college.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After my sickness, rowing felt like a big nuisance.  I rejoined the team halfway
through spring break, jogging on shore to get my lungs back.

I was still boated for the first race of the season at Harvard.  My boat
practiced in the morning before class, when there was still a thin sheet of ice
over the water.

It was my first time at the Harvard boathouse.  I thought of Mark Zuckerberg and
the men and women who had rowed from this boathouse, beautiful people.

We won our race, a long grind into the wind.  As my stroke started to fall apart
in the last five hundred meters, I looked over my shoulder for the finish.  I felt
panicked.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

In the robotics lab, I affectionately watched Allison debug a threading issue.
It was raining and warm outside.  Practice had been really hard, and I felt
myself fading.

``I'm really tired,'' I said to Allison.

``I think I've almost got this,'' she said, highlighting a block of code.

``Push it, and I'll take a look tonight,'' I said.

On the way to Allison's car we stopped at the Mexican-themed bar and ordered
draft beer.

``Can you believe it's almost over?'' I said.

``Are you excited?''

``So excited,'' I yelled, suddenly feeling emotional.  ``You must be
really excited, right?''

``Yeah.  I've never really left Ithaca,'' said Allison.

``Your parents must be really fucking proud,'' I said.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

We had another 2k, and I was relieved to keep my spot in the boat.  After easy
victories against Syracuse and Dartmouth, we travelled to race the Naval
Academy.

The water at Annapolis was flat and syrupy.  I felt a strong pressure on my
bladder during the minutes leading up to the start, and didn't feel ready.

Right after the sprint, we were up half a length.  The Navy boat was a bunch of
mismatched large guys with a stunted male coxswain.  We continued to walk as we
passed their docks, and then held for the last two hundred meters.

It was my first time beating Navy.  It was a beautiful day, and as I started to
recover, I looked forward to the empty bliss of the bus ride home.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Sunday, I sat down with a Coors Light to watch the video of the race.  I felt
buzzed and excited.

My excitement quickly turned to horror.  The video feed still had audio, and
right after the start I heard Coach say ``We've got to get Steady out of there,
I talked to him and he didn't make a change.''

It was obvious what he was referring to: I was leaning away from my oar at the
end of every stroke, throughout the entire race.  A technical problem.

This fucked me up, massively.  The coming week was going to be brutal.  They
were going to try to seat race me out of the boat.

I made myself go to yoga class immediately.

The thought of not racing again was unconscionable.  I had repeatedly imagined
the end of rowing.  One morning in early June, I was supposed look at my body in
the mirror, knowing it was the best it would ever be.  Then I would race, and at
the finish I would fall back into the boat, letting my hands slap the water, and
it would be over.

But now it seemed like I wouldn't get that moment.  Or, it had already happened.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After yoga, I didn't feel much better.  I went to the dining hall to work, but
ended up writing in my notebook about how disgusted I was by my presence in the
world.

I messaged Ariel, telling him how I felt.

``All of my friends seem to hate themselves pretty regularly,'' said Ariel
placidly.  ``It's something I've come to accept.''

``I don't want to hate myself, it's fucking stupid and I'm sick of it,'' I said.

Ariel didn't respond.

``Maybe I should just accept the Amazon offer and move to Seattle,'' I said.
``It'll be okay.''

``No, you should move to New York and be glamorous,'' said Ariel.  ``I think
when you look back on rowing it will be very indistinct.''

Maybe Ariel was right.  Maybe all of the practices and beauty would blur into a
single memory, something like having sweat in my eyes.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Surprisingly there was no seat racing on Monday or Tuesday, and I continued to
practice with my boat.  A line squall hit us at the base of the lake on Tuesday
afternoon.  My teammates whooped as we tried to row back into the inlet, and I
felt my heart go out to them.

On Tuesday evening Coach sent out an email to the team, acknowledging that a lot
was happening, but that we were ``living life'' and should enjoy it.

The seat racing happened on Wednesday morning.

I looked up at the hills and clouds above campus, noting that it might be the
last time I rowed in a serious way on Lake Cayuga.

My boat struggled, and lost by about a length and a half.  I climbed into the
other boat, and we lost again.

That afternoon, we did time trials.  I was dropped off on the dock while my
replacement did his trial.

After that, I was on land unless someone was unable to row.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On my first day of land squad, I put on my rowing trou and went to the erg room.
But the heaviness in my throat won out, and I went to the bathroom.  A few
lightweights were still there putting on sunscreen, so I went into one of the
stalls.

I willed myself to start to crying, and cried silently, in a hot and cathartic
way.

This wasn't how I wanted it to end.  It was bitter, like high school.

I had done this to prove something, and now it was over, but I still felt alone
and unsuccessful.  I had tried to live like these warlike youth, and it had gone
okay.

I had finished rowing, I told myself.  I had seen it through, and I had probably
done my best.

I thought back to the place I had found during spring break, thinking about the
future, New York City.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

I focused on school.

It was like being kicked in the face every day.  I'd go down to practice, erg
about 10k with my teammates, stretch, and then go read in the locker room.

Classes ended.  For two weeks, I programmed for about fourteen hours each day,
working on my video game class project.  I was satisfied with it.

At the end of the graduation ceremony, I walked out of Schoelkopf stadium,
suddenly unconcerned by the thousands of other students around me.  I walked
straight to where my parents, sisters, and grandparents were waiting.  We got
hotdogs and took some pictures.

``Come back to Donlon with us, we have some presents for you,'' said my mom.

``Okay, sounds great,'' I said.

On the way long walk up to North Campus, my grandfather said something about how
I could start making real money now.

``I'm not so sure I'll be focusing on that, right after graduation,'' I said,
and immediately regretted it, thinking about him at my age, with a four year old
daughter.

My grandfather was silent.  I had the feeling that he despised me, even if he
didn't know it himself.  I pushed the thought to the side.  I was too old for
things like that.

We sat around in the dorm room where my parents were staying, waiting.  My mom
gave me an unexpected \$1000 e-card, and some presents from my aunts.  She
seemed really happy with how things were going.

When my grandparents arrived, I opened their present, a toolbox.  It contained a
check for \$8000, and \$100 cash.

``Wow, thank you so much,'' I said.
