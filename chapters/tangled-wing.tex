``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  

``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?  I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor,
enjoying the feeling of my body after a workout.  The room was filled with warm
light from an electric windowsill candle.  I took a picture of myself, staring
into my own eyes, and uploaded it to a secret facebook group. 

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.  Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said. ``You should do it.''

A few days later, I flew to Seattle for a software engineering interview at
Amazon.  During the flight, I outlined my goals for the coming semester: 3.5 GPA,
6:12 2K, go on a date, read three books.  

When I got to my hotel, I sat outside in the dark and worked on some coding
problems. 

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking another class to increase the chances of being able to
go to state school,'' said Samuel.  

``How do you feel about writing a few papers and blog posts?  For ... \$1k?
Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do you want to pursue this?'' 

I knew I wouldn't have time.  My last semester at Cornell was going to be hard,
like all the other semesters.

But I also knew that the cycle of time debt, failure, fatigue, and hypomania was
going happen no matter what.  The ugly cycle was the path to progress.  It
stung, because at the beginning of college, I had tried to change my habits and
become the beautiful, strong, good person I wanted to be.  

``Sure, I'll do it,'' I texted Samuel.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The next morning I woke up feeling intuitively sad, and walked to the Amazon
campus.  About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split into
groups of three, and given laptops.  I tried to be social with the other
interviewees, despite a nervous silence.  I thought of soldiers standing in a
landing craft. 

As we booted our machines, a proctor gave each group a laminated booklet
detailing a programming problem.  We were supposed to work together.

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``You'll each submit your own code to the repository.''

As the room went silent, I felt a blind, helpless rage at my situation.  I
imagined standing up and walking out.  I wondered what the consequences of that
would be.  

After a minute, I took a few yoga breaths, smiled at my teammates, and started
to read the problem.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After the interview, I fell in with a group of the more confident, social
interviewees, and went to an atmospheric Asian restaurant in Belltown.

A guy from McGill, Ihsan, was showing me his mobile-optimized graphics engine.

``It's really close to the metal.  To optimize for mobile, I had to directly
open up buffers for matrix operations.  Cool stuff.''

A waitress brought us warm saki and sashimi, and we talked about our other
interviews.  All of us had interviewed at Facebook, some of us at Google.  

I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror after pissing.

Another Cornell guy told us about his genius boss at Palantir.  They had done
acid together, at work.

``That's terrifying,'' I said, picturing Palantir's glossy black office in
Chelsea.  I rested my face on my hand, thinking of Chelsea Manning alone in
Iraq, talking to anyone she could find on the Internet.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After dinner, we went to a legal recreational marijuana shop, the first and only
in Oregon.  I felt slightly ashamed when the cab driver knew exactly where we
wanted to go, but it was an great experience.

We found a small park near our hotel and smoked.  By the time I finished my
pre-rolled joint, I felt pretty high, but not paranoid or dysphoric.  The other
guys took it to the face. 

Ihsan started talking about how he thought he might not die, because of
computers.  The Taiwanese guy laughed manically and I smiled while listening to
the sound of the wind. 

We hesitantly talked about the future of computing, referencing the imminent
possibility of our employment at Amazon.  I imagined the glossy apartment I'd
live in, and how I could work with these guys on the weekend, developing some
sort of game engine.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The next morning I woke up early for a jog.

I had a bit of a weed hangover, so things felt surreal.  I ran downhill, wearing
a sweatshirt that I didn't need.

At the harbor, the horizon seemed close.  I walked along the boardwalk and
watched glassy bubbles well up in the green water, thinking of the programmers
at Microsoft working in this hyrdated environment.

I took a picture and sent it to my mom.  I thought about it for a moment, and
then said something about the legal marijuana shop.  She didn't respond.  I had
never talked to my parents about drugs.

I started to jog again.  The interview had gone well.  Assuming I got an offer
from Amazon, I'd move here. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

It was bitterly cold back in Ithaca.

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.
I felt hopeful and clear-headed after, showering with my teammates.  My back
muscles, hunched from the winter cold, relaxed under the hot water.

When I returned to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the
subject, a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively. 

I threw my phone onto a stack of clothes in my locker and started to get
dressed.  I'm totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't
make sense.  Unbelievable. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

A few hours later in human-robotics interaction class, the professor told us to
find a partner.  We were given five minutes to build a tower out of spaghetti,
string, marshmallows, and tape.  It was a competition.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She had a blemished
face and seemed to be almost thirty.  We instantly began to have difficulties
planning of our tower.  At some point we just started to build, and ended up
with a tower that was probably the second tallest in the classroom, until it
broke at the last second.

We joked uneasily, but it was obvious that we secretly blamed each other,
because we took these things seriously.

The professor told us that besides engineers, groups of kindergarteners
typically built the tallest towers.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

There was a snowstorm on Saturday night.   I went to the library and checked out
``Dangling Man'' by Saul Bellow, the first book for Samuel's class.

The main character did all of the unlikable, confrontational things I did in my
bad dreams,  where I screamed at the people in my life, my parents, my
teammates, my coaches, my friends.  I often quit things, saying that I never
really like rowing anyways, and then endured a deep, lucid regret until my alarm
went off.

The new Drake album came out.  It was good for making me feel darkly euphoric as
I walked between classes, a key emotion of my time at Cornell.  

In 2013 I had experienced a strange form of depression, when my life was falling
apart but I felt very good because I was going to practice twice a day, eating
well, and showering.  Eventually I signed up for a psychiatrist, who prescribed
an antidepressant and told me to drop some classes.  This fixed things,
basically. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

I told myself that rowing was the most important thing.  Last one, fast one.
The early winter workouts were long, but not particularly stressful or painful.
It was pitch black outside of the boathouse.

I was getting a pretty consistent 6.5 hours of sleep.  Every day I visualized
finishing my last race and lying down in the boat.  

``I'm going to need a lot more attention, love, and respect!'' I wrote in my
notebook. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

On Valentine's Day we did the `massacre', a 10k erg followed by a 3 mile run.
As in previous years, it wasn't too bad: in the cold, I could find a consistent
level of pain without abject suffering.

After getting home and spending a few hours in bed, I went to dinner with my
partner from robotics.  Her name was Allison.  We'd chosen to work together.  

Right after we sat down at our table, a small group of upperclassmen
rowers came in with girls.  I nodded at them over Allison's shoulder.  

I was happy that we'd picked the same restaurant.  I was proud of how civilized
they seemed, much better than most Cornell undergraduates, who I felt
lacked a critical sense of \textit{noblesse oblige}.

Allison and I talked about our first assignment, building a robot out of
cardboard.  Allison told me that she worked at a grocery store and could get a
lot of cardboard.  

After eating, Allison asked me about my post-grad plans.  

``I'm not exactly sure yet,'' I said.  ``Probably Amazon, if I'm willing to move
out there.''

``Cool,'' said Allison, nodding.  ``I think that's where I'm going to move,
too.''

``You got an offer somewhere on the west coast?''

``Yeah, at Google Research.''

``Awesome,'' I said.  ``Working on what?''

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}


Practices became harder.

I was having trouble pushing myself.  I remembered the broken, fast feeling of
being 20, the cold adrenaline trickling down my spine in the middle of a piece.
I would embrace the awful situation, despite the urge to look for a way out.  

Now some part of me just wanted it to be over, for someone to call it off,
cancel the race.  This was an ugly, old feeling from childhood.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The weekend before dry season, I drove a group of people up to the rowing house
on North Campus.

I clasped hands with Tom at the door, who introduced me to my date from
Tri-Delt.  She asked me how drunk I wanted to get, on a scale of one to ten, and
I said eight.  She said eight was a good number, and we did shots.  

After dinner, other people started showing up.  My date and I stuck together,
wandering around the crowded house.  It was a nice change from how I normally
felt at rowing parties: ignored by non-rowers, and darkly motivated to train
harder, so I'd get more respect from my teammates.

When it started to snow around midnight, we went outside along with almost
everyone else.  Some freshmen from both teams were naked, running laps around
the house.

I put my arm around my date, feeling validated by the beauty of the moment.   I
made sure to appreciate the long, straight country road on the opposite side of
Lake Cayuga, and the suggestive condensation on the windows of the house.  I'd
felt this many times. 

We went to the tree line and made out.  Her saliva had a strong taste, typical
of Cornell.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

We got really fucked up, doing lines of coke off of a photocopier upstairs.

Later when we were dancing, someone shattered a heavy glass beer boot across
the brick floor.  

``Woah, woah, woah'' yelled Andrew, pushing us away from the glass.  An Asian
guy wearing Vineyard vines was staring down Tom, fists balled up.  Tom lunged at
him.  We followed them outside.

``You're a fucking pussy,'' said Tom, smiling at the Asian guy.

The Asian guy swung at Tom, and a 230lb+ sophomore came running out of the house
and executed a wrestling takedown.  Now the whole house was standing on the
porch, some laughing and some concerned.

The commodore of the heavyweight team appeared to help the sophomore walk the
Asian guy away.  We sat with Tom, who was bleeding from his eye.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

When the house was almost empty, my date and I agreed to leave.  We walked
silently across the suspension bridge to Collegetown.  I felt a pressure, trying
to think of something to say.

We took the elevator up to the suite with some other women from Tri-Delt, who
were still up.  In her room we took off our clothes and starting kissing on the
bed.  She got up and turned off the light.

``I can't see,'' I said.  

``Yeah,'' she said.

We kept kissing, and I took off her bra.  I'd imagined hooking up with someone
from a rowing party many times.  We moved our hands downwards and I started
fingering her, listening to her breath.  Time passed.

``Pat, stop,'' she said.

``What?'' I said.

``You're not hard, Pat,'' she said.  Her hand was on my dick.  I stared down at
her eyes, glowing softly in the dark.  I started to kiss her again.

``Stop, you're not even hard,'' she said.

I stopped, still on top of her, looking down.

``Pat...'' she said.

``You're so gay, Pat,'' she said.  ``It's okay, my best friend is gay.''

``No, I'm not,'' I said, after a few incredulous seconds.

``Oh my god, yes you are.  You're so gay.  You like Tom, right?''

``What?  I'm not gay,'' I said.

``Okay, bi, then?  I could tell you really like Tom.  It's okay.''

``I don't know,'' I said.  ``No,'' I said.

I got off of her lay on my back.  A minute later she went out into the hall, and
then came back in and told me to get dressed.  I started to feel distantly
upset.

She walked me to the door, telling me that she adored me.  I apologized.  As the
door closed I heard her saying ``oh my god'' to her suitemates on the couch.

I stalked home blind drunk, feeling increasingly upset and letting my body go
slack against the cold wind.  Back in my room, I realized that I'd left my watch
at her place.  I wouldn't be able to ask for it back.  I let out a noise and
punched the wall. 

I hated that watch anyways, I told myself. I had been pressured into spending
\$500 on it by my grandfather.  I Facebook messaged an Internet girl while
writing into a Google doc, mostly in all-caps.  Then I put myself to sleep.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The next morning I woke up without a hangover, and jogged to North Campus to get
my car.  

The first essay for Samuel's class was due.  It was time to change my life.  I
wrote the first third of the essay before noon, writing about Joseph's doomed
rejection of the `code of the athlete'.

I went to a dining hall for lunch, and worked on my scalable systems assignment
while reflecting on what I wanted in life.

It seemed that at a base level, what I wanted most was a brand-name job at
Facebook, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, J.P.  Morgan, etc.  I wanted the
feeling of success that would come with such a job, and the six figure salary.

I continued this line of thought during yoga class, necessary for the coming
week.

It would be the easiest way to fix my life.  I knew it probably wouldn't
\textit{actually} fix my life.  But from my parents perspective, from everyone
else's perspective, it would.  

I wanted it more than I wanted the dismal, self-delusional success that I might
find in game development or writing.  It was the most pure thing to want. I
wanted it the way I wanted to hook up with hot, normal college students, for the
same reason that Samuel wanted to go to state school. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

On Monday morning we were told to warm up for a max squat test.  Tom and Seth
came over, Tom grinning widely despite his swollen and grotesque eye.

``Yo, Steadman, how was it with uh, Jennifer?  She was all over you,'' said
Seth.

``I don't fucking know, man,'' I said.

``She like, told us that you were bi?  What?  I was like Steadman?  No.''

``Yeah, noo,'' I laughed. ``I was just really fucked up.''

We stopped talking while the weight room coach went over the squat test
procedure. 

``Yeah, she was telling us...she said you said you were bi.  I was like
Steadman?  I don't think so.''

``I have no idea what the fuck I said.''

``It didn't seem like you really liked her that much,'' said Tom.

``Yeah, nah,'' I said.  ``Good times though.''

``Yeah buddy,'' said Seth.  ``Fucking typical.'' 

We went to find spotters for the test.

I did well, putting up some of the most weight on the team.  In the locker room
people asked me how much I had squatted and were impressed.  I felt optimistic
about my chances for the season and went to Uris library to take a nap before my
first class.

I felt good.

During my first few months on the team, I'd experienced a constant sense that my
teammates were calling me 'scrub' or 'bitch' behind my back.  I imagined that if
I ever showed my 'true self', their friendliness would turn to open hate.  I
imagined it would be like killing allies in a video game and having them all
instantly attack you, your crosshairs going from green to red. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

I stayed up late to finish Samuel's essay, mostly procrastinating before I
finally went into the cave.  I ended up finishing at 3:30am.

This messed up the rest of the week, a polar vortex week.

I emailed coach to tell him I had a fever and wouldn't be at practice, and then
met Allison at the robot lab to merge our teleoperation code.   Allison's code
was non-functional overall but included a bit of linear algebra that corrected
an issue I had with negative rotations for the robot's arm.

Around 1AM we walked home together, both shivering hard.  I felt lightheaded,
but happy to be talking to Allison.  After Allison got in her car, I stopped at
Collegetown Bagels to get some protein shakes and Gatorade.  It was full of
drunk people.  I felt sexually frustrated, but mostly tired.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

Things always seemed better when I was in control of my behavior.

We did bracket racing on Saturday morning.  It was sunny and warm.  That
evening, an injured rower came over and watched me install the computer game
``Deus Ex'' (1999).   On Sunday I went to yoga with a friend who I still kind of
wanted to date.

My quads felt large and hammy.  We were surprised by an easy workout Monday
night.  It was warm and we jogged to the Cornell plantations.

The big issue, I thought, was whether or not I would live out my life dreams.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

For my 23rd birthday, I had dinner with my parents at the hotel school
restaurant.  I told them I was evaluating the Amazon offer, but was looking for
other options.


I felt sick and nervous during the week leading up to our first 2k test, but it
went well.  I went into the pain cave at the right time, with about 800 meters
to go.  

``Wow, Steady, looks like you're going to PR this year,'' said a rower from my
year at dinner.  

The post-2k evening was wonderful, as always.  Some girls came over and we
played records on our record player.  

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

TODO: this sucks

During the week before spring break, the inlet was still choked with ice. We
drove twenty minutes up the lake to where the water was clear.  The practices
were long and frustrating.

On Thursday, my housemate Max drove us up the lake, so we could leave right
after we got off the water.  A release for my game development class was due the
next day, and I had to meet up with my group.

Coach had us doing five minute pieces against the 3V, starting half a
length up on them.  No one seemed very motivated in my boat: it was a weird
mixture of bright, windy, and cold. 

After a few bad pieces, Coach drove over in his launch to talk to us.  I stuck a
hand down under my balls to try to keep my fingers from going numb, which made
it hard to control the oar.

``How's it going guys,'' yelled Coach.  No one responded.

He pulled his launch back around towards us, against the wind.

``It's not enough,'' said Coach.  ``Just isn't enough, gentlemen.''

``Do you guys want to win?''

``Yeah Coach,'' said someone.

``You win a race like the Eastern Sprints, you walk away a different man.  You
might not look any different, but you'll sure as hell walk different, talk
different.'' ???

``You're going to have to dig really deep for that, though.  Go to that deep
dark place, and do your job.''  ???

We did a few more pieces which went worse.  I didn't get any feeling of torque
or swing.  

It was still fully light out when Coach told us to dock.  The coxswain fucked up
and we were blown into the rocky beach.  We got out of the boat and waded it in,
slipping over the rocky beach. 

My socks started to freeze as we tied the boat down on the grass.  Sitting on
Max's bumper, I shook the seashells out of my leather boat shoes.  It was
another absurd practice.  

I warmed up during the silent ride back to campus, leaving my ruined shoes
outside of my apartment.  

On my way to the Computer Science Undergraduate Lounge, I got two RockStar
energy drinks and a chicken parm.

Most of my game development project team was already there.  For a while, we all
worked in silence.  I was finishing up the death bounding box for the level.
Ivan and Joseph were talking about the memory leak.

``About 300 megabytes on each level load,'' said Ivan.  ``Christ,'' I said,
imagining 300 medium-length novels.  I felt my skin crawling with heat, but I
was making good progress, finally grokking C++.  I worked through the night
until our 10AM presentation, feeling exhausted.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The next day, I slept deeply from one to four in the afternoon and then went to
practice.  It turned out to be a relaxing 3x30 minutes of steady state.  

I felt lightheaded.  When I got home from practice, I knew I was sick.  

I went to Gannet the next afternoon.  It was quiet during spring break.

They did a blood test and told me I had pneumonia.  I emailed the coaches,
saying it might be a few days before I could practice again.

I went to the 7/11 and got as much food and beer as I could carry home.  I
started to drink and play Deus Ex.  

I did this for three days.  My pneumonia got pretty bad, requiring me to go to
the bathroom to cough up bile.  I felt guilty about not being at practice, but
it was okay.  I felt more guilty about not working on my game project. 
 
I played Deus Ex late into the night with my space heater at my feet.  I got so
drunk that the display swam in front of me.  The 2001-era graphics seemed
impossibly beautiful.  

When I drank wine or beer in Deus Ex, the screen got more and more distorted,
the effect stacking with each drink.  Sometimes it was almost impossible to tell
what I was doing, in the dark underground areas of the game, or stumbling around
my basement apartment, coughing until I couldn't breathe.

It was one of the happiest times I had during college.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After my sickness, rowing felt like a big nuisance.  I rejoined the team halfway
through break, jogging on the shore to get my lungs back.  

I was still boated for the first race of the season at Harvard.  My boat
practiced in the morning before class, when there was a thin sheet of ice over
the water.   The pleasant sound of the ice breaking in front of the boat spread
across the empty lake.
 
The long trip to Cambridge gave me time to think over things.  Was I a scrub?
It was my first time at the Harvard boathouse.  Inevitably I thought of Mark
Zuckerberg and the men who had rowed in this boathouse, beautiful people. 

We won our race, a long grind into the wind.  As my stroke started to fall apart
in the last 500 meters I looked over my shoulder for the finish, the first time
I'd ever done so in a race.  I felt panicked.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

In the robotics lab, I affectionately watched Allison debug a threading issue.
It was raining and warm outside.  Practice had been really hard, and I felt
myself fading.

``I'm really tired,'' I said to Allison.

``I think I've almost got this,'' she said, highlighting a block of code.

``Push it, and I'll take a look tonight,'' I said.

On the way to Allison's car we stopped at the Mexican-themed bar and ordered
beer.

``Can you believe it's almost over?'' I said.

``Are you excited?'' said Allison.

``So excited,'' I yelled deliriously, suddenly feeling emotional.  ``You must be
really excited, right?''

``Yeah.  I've never really left Ithaca.''

``Your parents must be really fucking proud,'' I said.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

I wrote another essay for Samuel, the second last.  We had another 2k, and I was
relieved to pull a decent time, not a PR, but good enough to keep my spot in the
boat.

After easy victories against Syracuse and Dartmouth, we travelled to race the
Naval Academy.  We were starting to think we could be the fastest fourth boat in
the east, a sort of comical, but also exciting idea.  It seemed fitting.  Racing
Navy would be the test.

The water at Annapolis was flat and syrupy.  I felt a strong pressure on my
bladder in the minutes leading up to the start, and felt very frustrated with
our warm-up.   

After the sprint we were up half a length.  The Navy boat was a bunch of
scrubby-looking large guys with a stunted male coxswain.  They didn't take
anything back, even as we passed their docks.  We held them through the last two
hundred and fifty meters and won.  It was my first time beating Navy.  It was a
beautiful day, and as I recovered in the bottom of the boat I looked forward to
the empty bliss of the long bus ride home.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

On Sunday, I sat down with a Coors Light to watch the video of the race.  I felt
buzzed and excited. 

My excitement quickly turned to horror.  The video feed still had audio, and
right after the start one could hear Coach say ``We've got to get Steady out of
there, I talked to him and he didn't make a change.''  

It was obvious what he was referring to: I was leaning away from my oar at the
end of every stroke, throughout the entire race.  A technical problem.

This fucked me up, massively.  The coming week would be painful and humiliating:
they were going to seat race me out of the boat.

I made myself go to yoga class immediately.  

The thought of not racing again was unconscionable.  

I had often visualized my last race.  I had imagined waking up one morning in
early June, and looking at my body in the mirror, knowing it was the best it
would ever be.  Then I imagined the finish of the race, falling back into the
boat, my hands slapping the cool water and my eyes closing, and it being over.

But now it seemed like I wouldn't get that moment.  Or, it had already happened.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After yoga, I didn't feel much better.  I went to the dining hall to work, but
ended up writing in my notebook about how disgusted I was by my presence in the
world.

I messaged Samuel, telling him how I felt.

``All of my friends seem to hate themselves pretty regularly,'' said Samuel
placidly.  ``It's something I've come to accept.''

``I don't want to hate myself, it's fucking stupid and I'm sick of it,'' I said.  

Samuel didn't respond.

``Maybe I should just accept the Amazon offer and move to Seattle,'' I said.
``It'll be okay.''

``No, you should move to New York and be glamorous,'' said Samuel.  ``I think
when you look back on rowing it will be very indistinct.'' 

I thought of the hundreds of practices, all of the intensity and beauty blurring
into one feeling, like sweat blurring one's eyes.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

Surprisingly there was no seat racing on Monday or Tuesday, and I continued to
practice with my boat.  A line squall hit us at the base of the lake, and waves
rolled over the shell as we tried to row back into the inlet.  My teammates were
whooping, and I felt my heart go out to them, for finding this fun.

On Tuesday afternoon Coach sent an email out to the team, acknowledging that a
lot was happening, but that we were ``living life'' and should enjoy it.

On Wednesday morning we went out in fours, obviously to seat race.

I looked up at the hills above campus, knowing it might be the last time I rowed
in a serious way on Lake Cayuga.  

I lost by about a length and a half.  In the afternoon, we did time trials.  I
was dropped off on the dock while my replacement did his trial.  I didn't ask.

After that, I was on land team unless someone was unable to row.
 
\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

On the first day I wasn't boated, I put on my rowing trou and went to the erg
room.  But the heaviness in my throat won out and I went to the bathroom.  A few
lightweights were still there putting on sunscreen, so I went into one of the
stalls.  Then I willed myself to start to crying, and cried silently, in a fully
warm and cathartic way.  

This wasn't how I wanted it to end.  It was bitter, like springs in middle and
high school, when I thought things were changing.  

I had done this to prove or change something, and now it was over, but I still
felt alone and unsuccessful.  I had tried to live like these warlike youth, but
maybe my natural place was quietly manic on the computer, the virtual place I
had found during spring break.  That was my reality.

But I had finished rowing, I told myself.  I had seen it through, and I had
probably done my best.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

I focused on school, mostly the video game class.

It was like being kicked in the face every day.  I'd go down to practice, erg
about 10k with my teammates, stretch or lift, and then go read in the locker
room.

Classes ended.  For two weeks, I programmed for about 14 hours each day, working
on my video game class project.  I was satisfied with it.

At the end of the graduation ceremony, I walked out of Schoelkopf stadium,
suddenly unconcerned by the other students around me.  I walked straight to
where my parents were waiting.  We got hotdogs and took some pictures.  

``Come back to Donlon with us, we have some presents for you,'' said my mom. 

``Okay,'' I said.  

On the way long walk up to North Campus, my grandfather said something about how
I could start making real money now.

``I'm not so sure I'll be focusing on that, right after graduation,'' I said,
and immediately regretted it, thinking about him at my age, with a four year old
daughter.  My grandfather was silent.  

I had the feeling that he despised me, even if he didn't know it himself.  I
pushed the thought to the side.  I was too old for thoughts like that.

My parents gave me new shoes and an e-card for \$1000 that said how proud they
were of my hard work.  

Finally I opened the present from my grandparents, a toolbox and a check for \$9000.  

``Thank you so much,'' I said.
