``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  

``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?  I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor,
enjoying the feeling of my body after a workout.  I took a picture of myself in
the warm light of the electric candle on the windowsill, and uploaded it to a
secret facebook group. 

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.  Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said calmly. ``You should do it.''

On January 18th, I flew to Seattle for a software engineering interview at
Amazon.  During the flight, I listed my goals for the coming semester: 3.5 GPA,
6:12 2K, go on a date, read three books.  

I didn't feel very stressed.  When I got to my hotel, I worked on coding
problems outside until the sun set.

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking another class to increase the chances of being able to
go to state school,'' said Samuel.  

``How do you feel about writing a few papers and blog posts?  For ... \$1k?
Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do you want to pursue this?'' 

I knew I wouldn't have time.  My last semester at Cornell was going to be hard,
like all the other semesters.

At the beginning of college, I had tried to change my habits and become the
beautiful, strong, clean person I wanted to be as a child.  But after five
years, I knew that the messy Cornell cycle was going to happen no matter what.
Time debt, failure, hypomania, wasted time.  It was natural, and I had to accept
it.

``Sure, I'll do it,'' I texted Samuel.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up feeling intuitively sad, and walked to the Amazon
campus.  About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split into
groups of three, and given laptops.  I tried to be social with the other
interviewees, despite a familiar nervous silence, a silence that reminded me of
soldiers standing in a landing craft. 

As we booted our machines, proctors gave each group a laminated booklet
detailing a programming problem.  We were supposed to work together.

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``You'll each submit your own code to the repository.''

As the room went silent, I began to feel a blind, helpless rage.  The interview
format was absurd.  I imagined standing up and walking out.  I wondered what the
consequences of that would be.  

After a minute, I made myself take a few yoga breaths, smile at my teammates,
and start to read the problem.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After the interview, I fell in with a group of the more confident, social
interviewees, and went to an atmospheric Asian restaurant in Belltown.

A guy from McGill, Ihsan, was showing me his mobile-optimized graphics engine.

``It's really close to the metal.  To optimize for mobile, I had to directly
open up buffers for matrix operations.  Cool stuff.''

A waitress brought us warm saki and sashimi, and we talked about our other
interviews.  Most of us had recently interviewed at facebook.

I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror after peeing.

Another guy, also from Cornell, told us about his genius boss at Palantir.  They
had done acid together at work.

``That's terrifying,'' I said, picturing Palantir's glossy black office in
Chelsea.  I rested my face on my hand, thinking of Chelsea Manning alone in
Iraq, talking to anyone she could find on the Internet.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After dinner, we went to a legal recreational marijuana shop, the first and only
in Oregon.  I felt slightly ashamed when the cab driver knew exactly where we
wanted to go, but the shop's employees made us feel welcome, and we left feeling
giddy.  

The cab took us to a park near our hotel.  By the time I finished my pre-rolled
joint, I was pretty high, but not paranoid or dysphoric.   The other guys were
fucking baked.  

Ihsan started talking about how he thought he might not die, because of
computers.  The Taiwanese guy laughed manically and I smiled, listening to the
wind in the damp leaves above.

We hesitantly talked about the future of computing, referencing the imminent
possibility of our employment at Amazon.  I imagined a glossy modern apartment,
and how I could work with these guys on weekends, developing some sort of game
engine.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up early for a jog.  I had a bit of a weed hangover, so
things felt surreal.  I ran downhill, wearing a sweatshirt that I didn't need.

The horizon seemed close at the harbor.  I walked along the boardwalk and
watched glassy bubbles well up in the green water, thinking of the programmers
at Microsoft working in this hydrated environment.

I took a picture and sent it to my mom.  I thought for a moment, and then said
something about the legal marijuana shop.  She didn't respond, and I felt a bit
concerned, but figured I was doing the right thing.

I started to jog again.  The interview had gone well.  Assuming I got an offer
from Amazon, I'd move here. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

It was bitterly cold back in Ithaca.

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.
I felt hopeful and clear-headed after, showering with my teammates.  My back
muscles relaxed under the hot water.

When I returned to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the
subject, a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively. 

I threw my phone onto a stack of clothes and started to get dressed.  I'm
totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't make sense.
Unbelievable.

A few hours later in human-robotics interaction, the professor told us to find a
partner.  We were given five minutes to build a tower out of spaghetti, string,
marshmallows, and tape.  It was a competition.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She had a blemished
face and seemed to be almost thirty.  We instantly began to have difficulties
with the planning of our tower.  

At some point we just started to build, and ended up with a tower that was
probably the second tallest in the classroom, until it broke at the last second.

We joked uneasily, but it was obvious that we secretly blamed each other,
because we took these things seriously.

The professor told us that kindergarteners typically built the tallest towers.
Groups of engineers sometimes did better.

On Saturday night, there was a snowstorm.  I went to the library and checked out
``Dangling Man'' by Saul Bellow, the first book for Samuel's class.

The main character did all of the unlikable, confrontational things I did in my
bad dreams.   In these dreams I screamed at all of the people in my life, my
parents, my coaches, my teammates, my friends.  I often quit things, saying that
I never really like rowing anyways, and then endured a deep, lucid regret until
my alarm went off.

I told myself that rowing was the most important thing.  The early winter
workouts were long, but not particularly stressful or painful.  It was pitch
black outside of the boathouse.

I was getting a pretty consistent 6.5 hours of sleep.  Every day I visualized
finishing my last race and lying down in the boat.  

``I'm going to need a lot more attention, love, and respect!'' I wrote in my
notebook. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Valentine's Day we did the `massacre', a 10k erg followed by a 3 mile run.
As in previous years, it wasn't too bad.  In the cold, I could find a consistent
level of pain without abject suffering.

After getting home and spending a few hours in bed, I went to dinner with my
partner from robotics.  Her name was Allison. 

As we sat down at our table, a group of upperclassmen rowers came in with girls.
I nodded at them over Allison's shoulder.  

I was happy that we'd picked the same restaurant.  I was proud of how civilized
they looked and acted, much better than most Cornell undergraduates, who seemed
to lack a critical sense of \textit{noblesse oblige}.

Allison and I talked about our first assignment, building a robot out of
cardboard.  Allison told me that she worked at a grocery store and could get a
lot of cardboard.  

Allison asked me about my post-grad plans.  

``I'm not exactly sure yet,'' I said.  ``Probably Amazon, if I'm willing to move
out there.''

``Cool,'' said Allison, nodding.  ``I think that's where I'm going to move,
too.''

``You got an offer somewhere on the west coast?''

``Yeah, at Google Research.''

``Awesome,'' I said.  ``Working on what?''

The new Drake album came out.  It made me feel darkly euphoric as I walked
between classes, a key emotion of my time at Cornell.  

The long walks through the snow to my diversity class on North Campus reminded
of the fall of 2013, when I had experienced a strange form of depression.  My
life had been falling apart, but I felt very good because I was going to
practice twice a day, eating well, and showering.  Eventually I signed up for a
psychiatrist, who prescribed an antidepressant and told me to drop some classes.
This fixed things, more or less.

Practices were getting harder.

I was having trouble pushing myself.  I remembered the broken, fast feeling of
being 20, the cold adrenaline trickling down my spine in the middle of a piece.
I would embrace it, despite the urge to look for a way out.  

Now some part of me just wanted it to be over, for someone to call it off,
cancel the race.  This was an ugly, old feeling from childhood.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On the last Saturday before dry season, I drove a group of people up to the
rowing house on North Campus.

I clasped hands with Tom at the door.  He introduced me to my date from
Tri-Delt, who asked me how drunk I wanted to get on a scale of one to ten. I
said eight.  She said eight was a good number, and we did shots.  

After dinner, other people started showing up.  My date and I stuck together,
wandering around the crowded house.  It was a nice change from how I normally
felt at rowing parties: ignored by non-rowers, and darkly motivated to train
harder, so I'd get more respect from my teammates.

When it started snowing around midnight, we went outside along with almost
everyone else.  Freshmen rowers from both teams naked, running around the house.

I put my arm around my date, feeling validated by the beauty of the moment.  I
made sure to appreciate the long, straight country road on the opposite side of
Lake Cayuga, and the suggestive condensation on the windows of the house.  I'd
felt this many times. 

We went to the tree line and made out.  Her saliva had a strong taste, typical
of Cornell.

Back inside, we followed an injured lightweight rower upstairs to do lines of
coke off of a photocopier. 

When we went downstairs I felt more and more distant, until someone shattered a
heavy glass beer boot across the brick floor.  

``Woah, woah, woah,'' yelled Alex, pushing my date and I away from the glass.
An Asian guy in Vineyard Vines was standing at the door, staring at Tom.

Tom lunged at him and they went out into the yard.

``You're a fucking pussy,'' said Tom, smiling.  The Asian guy swung at him,
hitting above Tom's eyes.  

Now everyone was standing on the porch.  A 230+lb Sophomore ran by me and
executed a wrestling takedown, screaming.  The commodore of the heavyweight team
appeared, and helped the sophomore walk the Asian guy away.  We sat with Tom,
who was bleeding.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

My date and I agreed to leave when the house was almost empty.  We silently
walked across the suspension bridge to Collegetown, bracing against the wind.  I
felt a pressure, trying to think of something to say.

My date shared a suite with some other women from Tri-Delt, who were still up.
In her room we took off our clothes and starting kissing on the bed.  She got up
and turned off the light.

``I can't see,'' I said.  

``Yeah,'' she said.

We kept kissing, and I took off her bra.  It was my first time hooking up with
someone from a rowing party.  We moved our hands downwards and I started
fingering her, listening to her breath.  Time passed.

``Pat, stop,'' she said.

``What?'' I said.

``You're not hard, Pat,'' she said.  Her hand was on my dick.  I stared down at
her eyes, glowing softly in the dark.  I started to kiss her again.

``Stop, you're not even hard,'' she said.

I stopped, still on top of her, looking down.

``Pat...'' she said.

``You're so gay, Pat,'' she said.  ``It's okay, my best friend is gay.''

``No, I'm not,'' I said, after a few seconds.

``Oh my god, yes you are.  You're so gay.  You like Tom, right?''

``What?  I'm not gay,'' I said.

``Okay, bi, then?  I could tell you really like Tom.  It's okay.''

``I don't know,'' I said.  ``No,'' I said.

I got off of her, and lay on my back.  A minute later she went out into the
hall, and then came back in and told me to get dressed.  I started to feel
distantly upset.

She walked me to the door, telling me that she adored me.  I apologized.  As the
door closed I heard her saying ``oh my god'' to her suitemates on the couch.

I stalked home, blind drunk.  I let my body go slack against the wind and
snowflakes, feeling increasingly upset.  Back in my room, I realized that I'd
left my watch at her place.  I wouldn't be able to ask for it back.  I let out a
noise and punched the wall. 

I hated that watch anyways, I told myself.  My grandfather had pressured me into
spending \$500 on it.   I sat down at my computer and facebook messaged an
Internet girl while writing into a Google doc in all-caps.  Then I put myself to
sleep.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The next morning I woke up without a hangover, and jogged to North Campus to get
my car.  

% TODO: "about"?

The first assignment for Samuel's class was due on Monday.  It was time to
change my life.  I wrote the first third of the essay before noon, developing a
thesis about Joseph's doomed rejection of the `code of the athlete'.

I went to a dining hall for lunch.  I worked on my scalable systems assignment
while reflecting on what I wanted in life.

It seemed that what I wanted most was a brand-name job at a company like
Facebook, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, J.P.  Morgan, etc.  I wanted the
feeling of success that would come with such a job, and the six figure salary.

I continued this line of thought during yoga class.

It would be the easiest way to fix my life.  I knew it probably wouldn't
\textit{actually} fix my life.  But from my parents perspective, from everyone
else's perspective, it would.  

I wanted it more than I wanted the dismal, self-delusional success that I might
find in game development or writing.  I wanted it in the pure way I wanted to
hook up with hot, normal college students; for the same reason that Samuel
wanted to go to state school. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Monday morning we were told to warm up for a max squat test.  As I tried to
shock my body into wakefulness, Tom and Seth walked over, Tom grinning widely
despite a grotesquely black eye.  

It was obvious they knew about the 'not hard' thing.

``Yo, Steadman, how was it with uh, Jennifer?  She was all over you,'' said
Seth.

``I don't fucking know, man,'' I said.

``She like, told us that you were bi?  What?  I was like Steadman?  No.''

``Yeah, noo,'' I laughed. ``I was just really fucked up.''

We stopped talking while the weight room coach went over the squat test
procedure.

During my first few months on the team, I always had a sense that my teammates
were calling me 'scrub' or 'bitch' behind my back, and I imagined that if I ever
showed my 'true self' their friendliness would turn to open hate. 

I imagined it would be like killing video game ally and having them all
instantly attack me, crosshairs going from green to red.  

``Yeah, she was telling us...she said you said you were bi.  I was like
Steadman?  I don't think so.''

``I have no idea what the fuck I said.''

``Didn't seem like you liked her that much,'' said Tom.

``Yeah, nah,'' I said.  ``Good times though.''

``Yeah buddy,'' said Seth.  ``Crazy night.'' 

We went to find spotters for the test.  I did well, putting up a lot of weight.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

I stayed up late to finish Samuel's essay, mostly procrastinating before I
finally finished at 3:30am.

This messed up the rest of the week, a polar vortex week.

I emailed coach to tell him I had a fever and wouldn't be at practice, and then
met Allison at the robot lab to merge our teleoperation code.   Allison's code
was non-functional overall but included a bit of linear algebra that corrected
an issue I had with negative rotations for the robot's arm.

Around 1AM we walked home together, both shivering hard.  I felt lightheaded,
but happy to be talking to Allison. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

The big issue, I thought, was whether or not I would live out my life dreams.
Things were better when I was in control of my behavior.  

On Saturday morning, bright sunlight filled the boathouse as we did bracket
racing on the erg.  My quads felt large and hammy.  I told myself it was time to
get fast and spend all of my time with rowers.

I stopped at Collegetown Bagels after practice in the afternoon.  It was full of
drunk people drinking sangria.  I felt sexually frustrated, but mostly tired.  

An injured rower came over that evening.  He smoked weed while watching me
install 'Deus Ex', the computer game of the year in 2001. 

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

For my 23rd birthday, my parents took me out to dinner at the hotel school
restaurant.  I told them I was evaluating the Amazon offer, but was looking for
other options.

I felt sick and nervous during the week leading up to our first 2k test, but it
went well.  I went into the pain cave at the right time, with about 800 meters
to go.  

The post-2k evening was wonderful, as always.  Some girls came over and we
talked and played records on our record player.  

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

During the week before spring break, the inlet was still full of ice.  We drove
up the late to practice on the cold, heavy water. 

It was still fully light out when we were told to dock on Thursday evening.  I
was anxious to get back to campus to work on my game development project, but
our coxswain missed the tiny dock.  We had to get out of the boat wade it in,
slipping over the rocky beach.

After tying the boat down on the soggy grass, I sat on someone's bumper and
shook the seashells out of my leather shoes.  It was another absurd practice.
I'd spent most of it with my hands under my balls for warmth, listening to Coach
talk about how winning would change us.  

Back on campus, I got two RockStar energy drinks and went to the Computer
Science Undergraduate Lounge.  I spent the night working with with my group on a
three-hundred megabyte memory leak.  I started to feel sick as we presented to
the professor the next morning.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

I went to Gannett after practice the next day.  It was quiet on the evening
before spring break.  They did a blood test, and told me I had pneumonia.

I went to the 7/11 and got as much food and beer as I could carry.  

For three days, I played Deus Ex and drank.  My sickness got pretty bad,
requiring me to go to the bathroom to cough up bile.  I felt guilty about not
being at practice, but it was okay.   

I discovered that when I drank alcohol in Deus Ex, the display was distorted,
the effect stacking with each drink.  The 2001-era graphics seemed impossibly
beautiful to me, late at night, with my space heater at my feet.  It was
sometimes almost impossible to tell what I was doing, in the dark underground
areas of the game, or stumbling around my basement apartment, coughing until I
couldn't breathe.

It was one of the happiest times I had in college.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After my sickness, rowing felt like a big nuisance.  I rejoined the team halfway
through break, jogging on the shore to get my lungs back.  

I was still boated for the first race of the season at Harvard.  My boat
practiced in the morning before class, when there was still a thin sheet of ice
over the water.

The long trip to Cambridge gave me time to think over things.  I felt like a
scrub.  It was my first time at the Harvard boathouse.  I thought of Mark
Zuckerberg and the men who had rowed in this boathouse, beautiful people. 

We won our race, a long grind into the wind.  As my stroke started to fall apart
in the last 500 meters, I looked over my shoulder for the finish, the first time
I'd ever done so in a race.  I felt panicked.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

In the robotics lab, I affectionately watched Allison debug a threading issue.
It was raining and warm outside.  Practice had been really hard, and I felt
myself fading.

``I'm really tired,'' I said to Allison.

``I think I've almost got this,'' she said, highlighting a block of code.

``Push it, and I'll take a look tonight,'' I said.

On the way to Allison's car we stopped at the Mexican-themed bar and ordered
draft beers.

``Can you believe it's almost over?'' I said.

``Are you excited?'' said Allison.

``So excited,'' I yelled deliriously, suddenly feeling emotional.  ``You must be
really excited, right?''

``Yeah.  I've never really left Ithaca,'' said Allison.

``Your parents must be really fucking proud,'' I said.

% TODO: laggy

We had another 2k, and I was relieved to pull a time good enough to keep my spot
in the boat.  Coach told us after that it was probably the last one.

After easy victories against Syracuse and Dartmouth, we travelled to race the
Naval Academy.  We were starting to think we could be the fastest fourth boat in
the east, a sort of comically exciting idea.  It seemed fitting.  Racing
Navy would be the test.

The water at Annapolis was flat and syrupy.  I felt a strong pressure on my
bladder during the minutes leading up to the start.   

After the sprint we were up half a length.  The Navy boat was a bunch of
scrubby-looking large guys with a stunted male coxswain.  We walked as we passed
their docks, and then held the last two hundred and fifty meters too win.  

It was my first time beating Navy.  It was a beautiful day, and as I recovered
in the bottom of the boat I looked forward to the empty bliss of the bus ride
home.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On Sunday, I sat down with a Coors Light to watch the video of the race.  I felt
buzzed and excited. 

My excitement quickly turned to horror.  The video feed still had audio, and
right after the start I heard Coach say ``We've got to get Steady out of there,
I talked to him and he didn't make a change.''  

It was obvious what he was referring to: I was leaning away from my oar at the
end of every stroke, throughout the entire race.  A technical problem.

This fucked me up, massively.  The coming week would be painful and humiliating,
as they tried to seat race me out of the boat.

I made myself go to yoga class immediately.  

The thought of not racing again was unconscionable.  I had always imagined the
morning of my last race, when I would look at body in the mirror, knowing it was
the best it would ever be.  Then I would race, and at the finish I would fall
back in the boat, letting my hands slap the water, and it would be over.

But now it seemed like I wouldn't get that moment.  Or, it had already happened.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

After yoga, I didn't feel much better.  I went to the dining hall to work, but
ended up writing in my notebook about how disgusted I was by my presence in the
world.

I messaged Samuel, telling him how I felt.

``All of my friends seem to hate themselves pretty regularly,'' said Samuel
placidly.  ``It's something I've come to accept.''

``I don't want to hate myself, it's fucking stupid and I'm sick of it,'' I said.  

Samuel didn't respond.

``Maybe I should just accept the Amazon offer and move to Seattle,'' I said.
``It'll be okay.''

``No, you should move to New York and be glamorous,'' said Samuel.  ``I think
when you look back on rowing it will be very indistinct.'' 

I thought of the hundreds of practices, all of the intensity and beauty blurring
into one feeling, like sweat in my eyes.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

Surprisingly there was no seat racing on Monday or Tuesday, and I continued to
practice with my boat.  A line squall hit us on Tuesday afternoon, and waves
rolled over the shell.  My teammates were whooping as we tried to row back into
the inlet, and I felt my heart go out to them.

On Tuesday evening Coach sent an email out to the team, acknowledging that a lot
was happening, but that we were ``living life'' and should enjoy it.

On Wednesday morning we went out in fours to seat race.

I looked up at the hills and clouds above campus, knowing it might be the last
time I rowed in a serious way on Lake Cayuga.

My boat lost by about a length and a half.  I climbed into the other boat, and
we lost again.

That afternoon, we did time trials.  I was dropped off on the dock while my
replacement did his trial. 

After that, I was on land unless someone was unable to row.
 
\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

On my first day on land, I put on my rowing trou and went to the erg room.  But
the heaviness in my throat won out and I went to the bathroom.  A few
lightweights were still there putting on sunscreen, so I went into one of the
stalls.  

I willed myself to start to crying, and cried silently, in a fully warm and
cathartic way.  

This wasn't how I wanted it to end.  It was bitter, like the springs of high
school, when I thought things were changing.  

I had done this to change something, and now it was over, but I still felt alone
and unsuccessful.  I had tried to live like these warlike youth, but maybe my
natural place was quietly manic on the computer, the virtual place I had found
during spring break.  That was my reality.

But I had finished, I told myself.  I had seen it through, and I had probably
done my best.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{}

I focused on school, mostly the video game class.

It was like being kicked in the face every day.  I'd go down to practice, erg
about 10k with my teammates, stretch or lift, and then go read in the locker
room.

Classes ended.  For two weeks, I programmed for about 14 hours each day, working
on my video game class project.  I was satisfied with it.

At the end of the graduation ceremony, I walked out of Schoelkopf stadium,
suddenly unconcerned by the other students around me.  I walked straight to
where my parents were waiting.  We got hotdogs and took some pictures.  

``Come back to Donlon with us, we have some presents for you,'' said my mom. 

``Okay,'' I said.  

On the way long walk up to North Campus, my grandfather said something about how
I could start making real money now.

``I'm not so sure I'll be focusing on that, right after graduation,'' I said,
and immediately regretted it, thinking about him at my age, with a four year old
daughter.  My grandfather was silent.  

I had the feeling that he despised me, even if he didn't know it himself.  I
pushed the thought to the side.  I was too old for things like that.

My parents gave me new shoes and an e-card for \$1000 that said how proud they
were of my hard work.  

Finally I opened the present from my grandparents, a toolbox containing a check
for \$9000.  

``Thank you so much,'' I said.
