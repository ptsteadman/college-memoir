Sometimes after work Ion my bed and grinned uncontrollably, thinking about
the money I was making.

It was dangerous to lay on my bed and think about myself.

I felt good in the morning, usually. Before I went to sleep, I opened the
blinds. My room had a very clean wooden floor that's warmed by the morning sun.

There is a certain part of me that always wanted discipline and order,
wanted to be organized and strong. I wanted a situation that would force me
to live properly, and I had failed to find it.

I'm better at bullshit, I realized. I had lost my ability to bullshit during my
first semester at Cornell, and I had been living in constant retreat since.

Breakfast was sort of like a meeting. I reported the information, prices, etc
that I got from America the night before, and offered my suggestions. Often we
discussed things for an hour or so, drinking coffee. Outside the window, the
workers were riding into the factory on scooters and bikes, checking in with the
security guard.

Sometimes around midday I thought silly things like "I'm going to the bathroom
and there I'll think really hard, and after that I'll just try to live the best
life I can and not worry about existential things."

There was a Japanese "technical advisor" living with us. He was in his sixties.
I appreciated his taste in aesthetic experiences.  After dark or early in the
morning, we would go on long cycling tours of the surrounding area. He owned a
pair of excellent racing bikes.  There wasN nighttime traffic, sprawling new
apartment housing developments, rice paddy canals, etc.  Asiatic cows.   It was
nice to appreciate these things with someone else.  One night there was the
moon.  He didn't speak English, and his Chinese wasn't very good.

I imagined buying an extremely clean apartment and furnish it simply and hiring
someone to clean and cook.

I felt calmer.  I had work and money, but not self-control.  I didn't live
regularly.  My social skills were somewhat improved, but only in a
Chinese/Japanese context.

"hmm what did we talk about back when we talked"

The day's work was done at 5:30, and we went upstairs for dinner.

Elma and I went to the customer's factory. All the other
engineers underestimated Elma because she is a woman and ugly. She made \$270 a
month. We walked into the room where they were sewing. There were about three
hundred women operating sewing machines. Elma said haoduomeinv.  (look at all the
beauties)  They were all mother-aged. It was loud and they were playing Teresa
Teng over the loudspeakers. It smelled of sweat and fabric. I felt lightheaded
but the music made me happy and I felt invigorated or something, like I had
just washed my face.

easy to romanticize with the largeness of the machinery and the weightiness of
the product. The area we live in smelled like freshly-machined steel.

Elma did a good job getting the marker files we needed and now I think we are
friends.

I explained the concept of wage slavery to Joy as we walked.

"like how he talks about wage labor, like earning the money and then spending
it on food (lattes and pizza) needed to repair/replenish my body for another
day zzz this is like everyone of course, but that thought/concept keeps running
through my head."

So that day I was in a bad mood when we returned to our factory. But then
Japanese boss called me into his office and gave me the first envelope with
"unoffical lifestyle fee". I ran upstairs and counted the brand new bills on my
bed.  Thousands of dollars.  Then we all went out for Japanese food at the
Westin hotel downtown.

I was very happy.
