``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Sounds like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor
after a workout, letting sweat dry on my face.

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said.

A few days later, I flew to Seattle for a software engineering interview at
Amazon.

When I got to my hotel, it was warm enough to sit outside in the dark and do
some coding problems.

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking another class to increase the chances of being able to
do the state school thing,'' said Samuel.  

``How do you feel about writing a few papers and blog posts?  For ... \$1k?
Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do you want to pursue this?'' 

``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The next morning I woke up feeling sad and walked to the Amazon campus, enjoying
the spring-like weather.  About thirty of us were shown into a large conference
room, split into groups of three, and given laptops.  I tried to be social with
the other interviewees, despite the familiar nervous silence that always
reminded me of soldiers standing in landing craft.

As we booted our computers, a proctor gave each group a laminated booklet
detailing a set of programming challenges.  We were supposed to work together,
but we would submit our own code independently at the end of the day.

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.

I momentarily felt a blind, helpless rage at my situation, and imagined standing
up and walking out of the interview.  I wondered what the consequences of that
would be.  

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After the interview, I fell in with a group of the more confident, social
interviewees, and we went to an atmospheric Asian restuarant in Belltown.

A guy from McGill, Saurabh, was showing me his mobile-optimized graphics engine.

``It's really close to the metal.  To optimize for mobile, I had to directly
open up buffers for matrix operations.  Cool stuff.''

A waitress brought us warm saki and sashimi, and we talked about our other
interviews.  All of us had interviewed at Facebook, some of us at Google.  

I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror.

One guy, also from Cornell, told us about his internship at Palantir.  He talked
about his boss, who was brilliant with computer science fundamentals, and told
us how they'd done acid together, at work. 

``That's terrifying,'' I said, thinking of Palantir's glossy black office in
Chelsea.  I imagined Chelsea Manning alone in Iraq, using an encrypted chat
client to try to find some sort of connection on the Internet, while trying to
act ``normal'' with her boss.

After dinner, we decided to go to a legal recreational marijuana shop, the first
and only in Oregon.

The cab driver knew exactly where we wanted to go.  I felt slightly ashamed, but
the purchasing experiencing was amazing.  Someone greeted us at the door and
made us feel comfortable, and the people behind the glass display cases seemed
to share our disbelief at process of buying weed legally.

After going to another restaurant, we found a park somewhere near our hotel.

We removed the pre-rolled joints from their plastic tubes and passed around a
lighter.  By the time I finished my joint, I felt pretty high, but not paranoid
or dysphoric.  The other guys were stupidly high.

Saurabh stared at each of us with wide eyes.  ``Do any of you guys feel that you
might not die?  Like, you might live forever because of computers,'' he said.

The sober Taiwanese guy laughed manically.  I smiled and listened to the wind in
the trees above.

``Like Amazon Web Services is a homeostatic living thing, sort of?  And if we
get offers from Amazon our code will become a part of it.  This sort of process
will continue until the uh recent advances in statistical machine learning are
unified with the symbolic AI research of the 80's and the singularity happens.''

I thought of all of the layers of silicon computing in the dark Palantir office,
or their virtualized cloud infrastructure.  The other Cornell guy was rocking
back and forth.

``People who don't understand computers are going to have to have a hard time,''
said the Cornell guy.

``Yeah, they're fucked,'' said Saurabh.

``I don't know,'' I said.

Back at the hotel, waiting to fall asleep, I looked up the typical offers for
SE1's at Amazon.  Some were barely into the six figures, but they all included
at least a 40k starting bonus.

The next morning I woke up early for a jog.

I had a bit of a weed hangover, so things felt surreal.  It was warm out though.

I ran downhill, towards the ocean.

When I arrived at the harbour, I walked for a moment.  The horizon seemed close,
and glassy bubbles welled up in the green water.  I thought of the programmers
at Microsoft working in this hydrated environment. 

I took a picture and texted it to my mom, and then told her about the legal
marajuana shop.  She didn't respond to this, which I found both funny and
concerning.  I had never talked to my parents about any sort of drugs before. 

The interview had gone very well.  Assuming I got an offer from Amazon, I'd move
here.

It was bitterly cold back in Ithaca.

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.
I felt hopeful and clear-headed after, and showered with my teammates.

When I got back to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the
subject.  It was a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively. 

I threw my phone onto a stack of clothes and started to get dressed.  I'm
totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't make sense.
Unbelievable.

In human-robotic interaction, the young professor told us to find a partner, and
then gave us five minutes to build a tower out of spaghetti, string,
marshmellows, and tape.  It was a competition.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She had a blemished
face even though she seemed to be almost thirty.  We instantly began to have
difficulty with the planning of our tower.  

I wanted to incorporate the string, but she didn't think it'd help.  At some
point we just started to build, and ended up with a tower that was probably the
second tallest in the classroom, until it broke at the last second.

We joked about our tower uneasily, but it was obvious that we were secretly
blaming each other, and took these things seriously.

The professor told us groups of kindergarteners typically built taller towers
than all other types of groups, except for engineers.

The first book I read for Samuel's class was 'Dangling Man' by Saul Bellow.  I
checked it out of the library on a Saturday night during a snowstorm.

The main character was very unlikable. He did a lot of the confrontational
things I did in my bad dreams.  I dreamed of screaming at all of people in my
life, my parents, my rowing coach, my friends and teammates.  Often I quit the
rowing team, saying that I never really liked rowing anyways, and endured a
lucid, deep regret that didn't go away until my alarm went off.

After a brief period of hope I resumed the familiar Cornell cycle of hypomania,
time debt, failure, fatigue, and Internet.  At the beginning of college, I had
tried to change my habits and become the beautiful, strong, good person I wanted
to be.  But reality had forced me accept that the cycle was natural.

I still wanted some sort of catharsis.  The most important thing was rowing.

The early winter workouts were very long, but not particularly stressful or
painful.  My classes were mostly focused on group projects, and I typically had
to go to meetings after practice, and arrived home exhausted.  I was getting a
pretty consistent 6.5 hours of sleep.

My most important class was my game class.  I felt I could potentially becomea
great video game programmer.  I was happy when I was appointed group leader.  On
weekend nights I cooked for myself, but would barely be able to finish the dry
food and a tallboy of Yuengling Lager before falling asleep at my desk, trying
to write C++.

``I'm going to need a lot more attention, love, and respect!'' I wrote in my
notebook.

The Valentine's Day massacre was always less awful than expected, possibly due
to the feeling of piecing in the morning and running through the forests of
Ithaca in February.  It was relatively easy to find a consisent level of pain
pain in the quiet cold, a state of pain without abject suffering. 

That evening, I went to dinner with my partner from robotics.  Her name was
Allison.  We'd chosen to work together.  

Right after Allison and I sat down at the restuarant, a small group of rowers,
mostly Juniors, came in with girls.  I nodded at them, over Allison's shoulder.
I was happy that they'd chosen the same restaurant, the one restaurant I liked
in Ithaca.  I was proud of how civilized my teammates looked, much more
civilized than the other undergraduates, who usually seemed so weak and
undisciplined.

``Have you seen the brushes that they use on cows?'' said Allison.  We were
discussing a robot that would assist dishwashers, our first assignment.

``No,'' I said.

We ate.  I was happy when Allison got a third drink with me.

Allison wanted to know where I was working after graduation.

I knew that Allison currently worked at a supermarket. 

``I'm not exactly sure yet,'' I said.  ``Probably Amazon, if I'm willing to move
to the west coast.''

``Cool,'' said Allison, nodding.  ``I think that's where I'm going to move,
too.''

``You got an offer somewhere there?''

``Yeah, at Google Research.''

``Awesome,'' I said.  ``Working on what?''

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The workouts became darker.  

I was having trouble pushing myself.  When I was 20, during a tough workout
sometimes a good EDM song would come on and I'd feel a trickle of cold
adrenaline and want to push more.  Something about the awful situation made me
embrace it, despite the urge to look for a way out.  It had been a broken
feeling, that felt something like crying, but it was fast.

Now some part of me just wanted it to be over, for someone to call it off,
cancel the race.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

The weekend before dry season, I drove a group of people to the rowing house on
North Campus.

When I arrived, I said hi to my date from Tri-Delt, who talked to me in a very
engaging way.  We'd been set up.  She asked me how drunk I wanted to get, on a
scale of 1-10, and I said 8.  She said 8 was a good number, and we did shots.
Then we sat down for dinner.

People started to arrive as we did dishes, people I recognized from other rowing
parties.  

My date and I stuck together, wandering around the crowded house and dancing. It
was a nice change from how I normally felt at these parties: ignored by
non-rowers, and darkly motivated to train harder, so I'd get more respect from
my teammates.

It started snowing around midnight.  We went outside, along with the majority of
the people at the party.  It wasn't very cold.  Some sophomores from the men's
and women's team were naked, running laps around the house.

I put my arm around my date, and felt validated by the beauty of the moment.   I
took time to appreciate the long, straight country road on the opposite side of
Lake Cayuga, and the suggestive condensation on the windows of the rowing house.
I'd felt this many times.

We made out. Her saliva had a strong taste, typical of Cornell.  An injured
rower from my year invited us up to his room, where we did lines of coke with
some lightweights.  I had decided to not do coke any more after breaking up with
my ex, so I just gummed some.  

I was impressed by the hedonism of my teammates, and the amount of vaporized
smoke in the room.  Then we went back downstairs to dance, now very fucked up,
in a sort of stunned way.  

A heavy glass beer boot shattered accross the brick floor, and an tall Asian guy
I didn't recognize stood at the door with his fists balled up, staring down Tom,
a quiet, sardonic rower, also from my year.  

``Oh shit,'' I said quietly, and was pushed away from the glass by Andrew, who
was yelling "woah, woah, woah".  Tom stepped around the glass and lunged towards
the Asian guy, and we followed them outside.  The snow had stopped.

``Why is he fighting here,'' I said.  ``There's no way he can win.'' 

The Asian guy took a few steps towards Tom, raising his hands.  He was
expessionless.

``You're a fucking pussy,'' said Tom, smiling. 

The Asian guy swung at Tom, the second punch hitting above Tom's eye.  Tom threw
himself on the Asian guy, trying to wrestle him to the ground.  A 230lb+
sophomore came running out of the house and jumped onto the Asian guy, 
putting him into a headlock and screaming at him.   Now the whole house was
standing on the porch, some laughing and some concerned.

The commodore of the team came over and helped the sophomore drag the Asian guy
away.  We helped Tom put a rag on his bleeding brow and sat with him.

My date and I decided to leave, walking across the suspension bridge to where
she lived in Collegetown.  I felt a pressure, trying to think of something to
say.

She shared a suite with some other women from Tri-Delt, who were still up.  In
her small room, we took our clothes off, and starting kissing on the bed.  She
got up and turned off the lights.

``I can't see,'' I said.  

``Yeah,'' she said.

We kept kissing, and I took off her bra.  I'd imagined hooking up with someone
from a rowing party many times.  We moved our hands downwards and I started
fingering her, listening to her breath.

``Pat, stop,'' she said.

``What?'' I said.

``You're not hard, Pat,'' she said.  Her hand was on my dick.  I stared down at
her eyes, barely visible in the dark.  I started to kiss her again.

``Stop, you're not even hard,'' she said.

I stopped, but stayed on top of her, looking down.

``Pat...'' she said.

``You're so gay, Pat,'' she said.  ``It's okay, my best friend is gay.''

``No, I'm not,'' I said, after a few moments.

``Oh my god, yes you are.  You're so gay.  You like Tom, right?''

``I'm not gay,'' I said.

``Okay bi then?  I could tell you really Tom.  It's okay.''

I had often shown pictures of my rowing teammates to my Internet friends.

``I don't know,'' I said.  ``No,'' I said.

I got off of her and stared up at the ceiling.  A minute later she went out into
the hall, and then came back in and told me to get dressed.  I started to feel
distantly upset.

I pulled on my clothes and then she walked me to the door of her suite.  She
told me that she loved me.  As the door closed I heard her saying ``Oh my god''
to her suitemates on the couch.

I stalked home, blind drunk, feeling increasingly upset and cold.  Back in my
room, I realized that I'd left my watch at her place and punched the wall.  I
wouldn't be able to ask for it back.  I hated that watch anyways, I told myself,
my grandfather had pressured me into spending \$500 on it.  I went on facebook
and messaged an Internet girl while writing into a Google doc, both mostly in
all-caps.  Then I put myself to sleep.

I woke up the next morning without a hangover, and jogged to North Campus to get
my car.  Samuel's first essay was due on Monday.  It was time to change my life.
I wrote the first third of the essay before noon, writing about Joseph's initial
rejection of the 'code of the athlete', and the eventual failure of
self-reflection.

I went to the dining hall for lunch, and did an assignment for my scalable
systems class while reflecting on what I wanted in life.  It seemed that what I
wanted most keenly was a brand-name job at Facebook, Google, Amazon, Goldman
Sachs, J.P.  Morgan, etc, and the feeling of success that would come with it.
Getting a job like that seemed the easiest way to fix my life, even if I knew it
probably wouldn't really fix my life.  But from my parents persepctive, everyone
else's perspective, it would.  I wanted it more than I wanted the dismal, dark,
self-delusional success that I could possibly find in writing or game
development.  I wanted it the way I had wanted to hook up with hot, normal
college students, for the same reason that Samuel wanted to state school. 

I went to get more pancakes.  My yoga class would start soon.  I felt a petulant
stab of anger at the events of the night before.  I had done everything right,
in college, after a rough start.  I couldn't figure out why Facebook and Amazon
hadn't given me an offer, and I didn't understand why I'd been so alone all
throughout college.

At Monday morning lift we were testing max squat and max pullups.  After the
warmup Tom and Gordon came over, Tom grinning in a shit-eating way.  He had an
extremely swollen eye, he had told Coach it was caused to 'pond hockey', causing
laughter.

``Yo, Steadman, how was it with uh, Jennifer?  She was all over you,'' said Tom.  

``I don't fucking know, man,'' I said.

``She like, told us you were bi?  What?  I was like Steadman?  No.''

``Yeah, no.  I was just really fucked up,'' I said.  We stopped talking while
the weight room coach gave us the standard instructions for the squat test.

``Yeah, she was telling us...she said you said you were bi.  I was like
Steadman?  I don't think so.''

``I have no idea what the fuck I said.''

``Didn't seem like you really liked her that much,'' said Tom.

``Yeah, nah,'' I said.  ``Good times though.''

``Yeah buddy,'' said Tom, and we went to find spotters for the test.

I did well on both the squat test and the pull up test, putting up some of the
most weight on the team.  In the locker room 




Feeling comfortable with my sexuality was sort of like discovering a hidden room
in the basement of my childhood home.  The beautiful confident place I had found
with Lisa and Anna was a place I knew I could go back to.  My past worries were
gone, I didn't have to ``come to terms with my sexuality'', I didn't have to be
afraid or ashamed.  I was coming to realize that my sexuality was one of the
least problematic aspects of my personality.
 
During my first fall on the Cornell rowing team, I had a constant sense that all
of my teammates were calling me ``faggot'' or ``pussy'' behind my back.  I
imagined that if I showed my ``true self'' their friendliness would turn into
open hate, like when you kill allied soldiers in a video game, and they start
attacking you and your crosshairs go from green to red.

Sometimes I heard the parties of my upstairs neighbors, other seniors on the
team, where they listed to old records and talked.  According to my friend from
Freshman year, these people were true `beautiful people`, and I agreed.  I felt
ill at ease at these events, which I supposed I was invited to.  After one of
these events, late at night, I heard a male voice sobbing violently, but I
didn't go upstairs to figure out why.

``Don't get frantic about the cold; if God didn't punish us, we would just
punish ourselves even more,'' yelled Coach Terry.  It felt like skiing weather

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach Terry.  ``You ever heard the story about the
chicken and the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon
and egg breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the
bacon and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says:
``The chicken worked hard to make this breakfast.  But the pig, he was

I slept deeply from one to four in the afternoon and then went to practice,
which turned out to be a relaxing 3x30 minutes of steady state.  It was warm
enough to run outside, and it was still light out.

I felt lightheaded.  That night, as I felt the incredible release of the
beginning of spring break, I knew I was sick.  

I had pneumonia.  I emailed the coaches, saying it might be a few days before I
could practice.

I got as much food and beer as I could carry back from the 7/11.  I decided I'd
give myself a day or two to recover.  I started to drink and play Deus Ex.  

I did nothing but drink and play Deus Ex for almost three days.  My pneumonia
was pretty bad, requiring me to go to the bathroom to cough bile into the
toilet.  I felt guilty about not being at practice, but it was okay.  I felt
more guilty about not working on the game.  But I knew that experiencing Deus
Ex, the game of the year in 2000, was important for me.

I played very late into the night, basically sitting on my space heater.  At
night I would get so drunk that the display swam in front of me, and I felt that
the old graphics were impossibly beautiful.  In Deus Ex, when JC Denton drinks
wine or beer, or does drugs, the screen gets more and more distorted with every
drink.  Sometimes it was almost impossible to tell what I was doing, in the dark
underground areas of the game or stumbling around my basement apartment with a
beer, coughing in the bathroom.

It was one of the happiest times I had during college.

It was painful to be a loser in their presence.  

``All of my friends that I admire seem to hate themselves pretty regularly,''
said Samuel placidly.  ``It's something I've come to accept.''

``I don't want to hate myself, it's fucking stupid and I'm sick of it,'' I said.  

Samuel didn't respond.

``Maybe I should just accept the Amazon offer and move to Seattle,'' I said.
``It'll be okay.''

``No, you should move to New York and be glamorous,'' said Samuel.  ``I think
when you look back on rowing it will be very indistinct for you.'' 

Maybe I should have quit two years ago.  I had never seriously considered the
idea before.

I had often imagined the end of rowing.  I had imagined waking up one morning in
early June, and looking at my body in the mirror, knowing it was the best it
would ever be.  Then I imagined  the finish of the race, falling back into the
fragile boat, my hands slapping the cool water and my eyes closing, and it being
over.

But now it seemed like I wouldn't get that moment.  Or, it had already happened.

Surprisingly, there was no seat racing on Monday morning, and I kept my seat in
the boat.  But on Tuesday...

During early spring I was usally awoken a few minutes before my 5:50 AM alarm by
the sound of my teammates coming down the stairs and getting some breakfast.  I
had developed the habit of waking up around 4:30 AM to drink a Gatorade and eat
a peanut butter and jelly so I'd wake up hydrated and ready to pee, so there
wouldn't be any pressure on my bladder in the boat. 

``You're living life,''

I looked up at the hills above campus, knowing it might be the last time I rowed
in a serious way on Lake Cayuga.  Won by about a length of open water.  ``Yeah
'' 

I knew that despite the part of me that wanted to be like these warlike youth,
my equilibrium was being quietly manic on my computer, in the the place I'd
found myself in during spring break.  I cared more for the virtual text of any
given momment than I cared about winning or losing.  I had never really wanted
to exert myself like this, but of course I had been necessary to try.  I'd done
it to prove something to myself and others, and to some degree I'd be
successful, but now it was over and I still felt alone and unsuccessful.

I put on my rowing trou and a tank top, but on the way to the erg room the
heaviness in my throat won and I went to the bathroom.  A few lightweight
rowers were still there putting on sunscreen, so I went into one of the stalls.
Then I willed myself to start to crying heavily but silently, in a fully warm
and cathartic way.  

It was more bitter than I had hoped.  It was like many springs in middle school
and high school,

``Come back to Donlon with us, we have some presents for you,'' said my mom. 

``Okay,'' I said.  

We made the long walk back to the dorms.  My grandfather said something about
how he remembered work seeming like a vacation after college, and that I could
start making real money now.

``I'm not so sure I'll be focusing on that, right after graduation,'' I said,
and immediately regretted it, thinking about him at my age, with a four year old
daughter.  He was silent.  My dad and I talked about my plans for the next
couple months.  I again had the feeling that my grandfather despised me, even if
he didn't know it himself.  I pushed the thought to the side, thoughts like that
weren't any good for a 23 year old.

Back at the dorm I sat around while my sisters changed.  I felt relaxed.

I opened presents from my aunt and great aunt first.  Both had given me \$100
checks.  I was surprised and happy.  My parents had given me new shoes, and
would later send me an e-card for \$1000, saying they were proud of my hard
work.  

Finally I opened the present from my grandparents.  The card on the outside
contained a check for \$4000.  

``Thank you so much,'' I said.
