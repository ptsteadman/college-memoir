``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor,
feeling good and warm after a workout.

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

It was Buffalo, New York, 2015.  I had gone out to dinner with my parents and
sisters that evening.  The restaraunt had seemed too nice for my hometown, with
high ceilings and bronze light.  I had overheard a group of older men talking
about the warehouses they were leasing to marajuana growers in Colorado.  I felt
that the world was changing, that my family was changing.  I had ov  I was
excited to go back to school, and finish it. 

``No, I get it,'' I said.

A few days later, I flew to Seattle with my dog Allison in her purse bag.
Allison is an unusually smart dachshund that I've owned since I was 20, when I
bought her because I was depressed.  I love her.  

I felt happy and relaxed.  I had a software engineering interview at Amazon the
next day.   It was warm enough to sit outside and drink a Hot Toddy while I did
some coding problems. 

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking a fifth class to increase the chances graduating in May
2018 with only six semesters on campus,'' said Samuel.  I put my notebook away.

``How do you feel about writing a few papers, nothing over ten pages,
and some blog posts?  For â€¦ 1k?  Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.
Do you want to pursue this at all?'' 

``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it.

Amazon employees are allowed to bring dogs to work, and I had confirmed that
Allison could come to the interview.  I walked to the Amazon campus with
her, on a confusingly spring-like morning. 

About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split into groups of
four, and given laptops.  I tried to be social. 

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``We'll be pulling you out individually for about twenty minutes to discuss your
part of the problem.  Feel free to ask us any questions.'' I flagged down one of
the 

On the way out of the Amazon building, I started talking a guy who had mentioned
being interested in graphics.  He seemed quite intelligent.  Some other
interviewees gravitated to us, and we walked downtown as a group, talking loudly
and confidently about computer science.  One of the quieter guys was on yelp,
trying to find a nice place for dinner.

About a half hour later we ended up at an atmospheric Asian place.

Something concise about: feeling of rage, getting high with other interviewees, jog.

This would be my life.

``You did acid with your boss at Palantir?  That's terrifying.''

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.

I showered with my teammates after, feeling good.

When I got back to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the
subject.  It was a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively.  I read
through the email in disbelief.

I threw my phone onto the stack of clothes in my locker and started to get
dressed.  I'm totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't
make sense.  Unbelievable.

In robotics class, the young professor told us to find a partner, and then gave
us five minutes to build the tallest tower we could out of spaghetti, string,
paper, and tape.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She seemed older,
with a blemished face and lots of clothing.  She looked tired and effective, and
we instantly began to have difficulty regarding the planning of our tower.  I
wanted to incorporate the string, she didn't think it'd help.

After the Valentine's Day massacre.

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach Terry.  ``You ever heard the story about the
chicken and the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon
and egg breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the
bacon and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says:
``The chicken worked hard to make this breakfast.  But the pig, he was
committed.'' I tried to shake the seashells out of my loafers so I could at
least wear them back to campus. 

Bounding box.  the parameters for death.

``About 300 megabytes on each level load,'' said Cristian.  ``Christ,'' I said.
Mentally I imagined 300 medium-length novels.  ``The player has to be able to
see themselves die, or they won't know why they died.'' 

	Spitting.  It was one of the happiest times I had during college.
	

It was painful to be a loser in their presence.  

I looked up at the hills above campus, and noted the light and clouds and
glassiness of the water.  I knew it might be the last time I rowed in a serious
way on Lake Cayuga.  Won by about a length of open water.  ``Yeah Steady,'' False
spring, writing paper, end of rowing, sunscreen.
