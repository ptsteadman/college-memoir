``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''
``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I
was lying on my bedroom floor, enjoying the warm feel after a workout.  xxx?
``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Columbia.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.''
``No, I get it,'' I said.  xxx

A few days later, I flew to Seattle with my dog Allison, who slept in her purse
bag.  Allison is an unusually smart dachshund that I've owned since I was 20.
I love her.  

I had a software engineering interview at Amazon the next morning.  I don't
remember how I got to the hotel, but I remember feeling happy and relaxed.  It
was warm enough to sit outside with Allison at the pizza place represented by
the front desk.   I drank a Hot Toddy and did some coding problems until it
became dark.  

``I'd love to graduate in May 2018 with only six semesters on
campus,'' said Samuel on Facebook Messenger.  ``I'm considering taking a fifth
class to increase the chances of this happening.  How do you feel about writing
a few papers, nothing over ten pages, and like some blog posts?  For â€¦ 1k?
Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do you want to pursue this at
all?'' ``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it.

Amazon allows employees to bring dogs to work, and I had confirmed with my
recruiter that it'd be ok for me to bring Allison to the interview.  I walked.
It felt like a spring morning.  It was supposed to be a collaborative coding
exercise.  About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split
into groups of four, and given laptops.  ``You have until 3pm to finish your
implementation,'' said the head interviewer.  ``We'll be pulling out out
individually for about twenty minutes to discuss your part of the problem.
Feel free to ask us any questions.'' I flagged down one of the

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach.  ``You ever heard the story about the chicken and
the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon and egg
breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the bacon
and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says: ``The
chicken worked hard to make this breakfast.  But the pig, he was committed.'' I
tried to shake the seashells out of my loafers so I could at least wear them
back to campus.  Bounding box.  the parameters for death.  ``About 300 megabytes
on each level load,'' said Cristian.  ``Christ,'' I said.  Mentally I imagined 300
medium-length novels.  ``The player has to be able to see themselves die, or
they won't know why they died.''

It was painful to be a loser in their presence.  

I looked up at the hills above campus, and noted the light and clouds and
glassiness of the water.  I knew it might be the last time I rowed in a serious
way on Lake Cayuga.  Won by about a length of open water.  ``Yeah Steady,'' False
spring, writing paper, end of rowing, sunscreen.
