``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Sounds like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor.
I'd just finished a workout, and sweat was drying on my face.  

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said.  Samuel wanted to see himself through the eyes of
normal American women and kill it in his literature classes.  Starting at a new
school would let him to go back in time and re-live the fantasy of starting
college again.

A few days later, I flew to Seattle for a software engineering interview at
Amazon.

When I got to my hotel, it was warm enough to sit outside in the dark and do
some coding problems.

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking another class to increase the chances of graduating in
May 2018 with only six semesters on campus,'' said Samuel.  

``How do you feel about writing a few papers and blog posts?  For ... \$1k?
Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.  Do you want to pursue this?'' 

``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it at some point in the coming months.

I walked to the Amazon campus on a spring-like morning.  About thirty of us were
shown into a large conference room, split into groups of three, and given
laptops.  I tried to be social with the other interviewees, despite the nervous
silence that always reminded me of soldiers standing in D-Day landing craft.

As we booted our computers, a proctor gave each group a laminated booklet
detailing a programming problem. 

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.

I looked at the other people in my group.  We read through the problem silently.

``Can we make our code interdependent?'' I asked a proctor.

``We strongly recommend against that, given the time constraints.''

For a moment, I felt a blind, helpless rage at the stupidity of my situation,
and imagined standing up and walking out of the interview.  I wondered what the
consequences of that would be.  

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

After the interview, I went to an atmospheric Asian restuarant in Belltown with
a group of the more confident, social interviewees.  

The McGill guy, Saurabh, was showing me his mobile-optimized graphics engine.

``It's really close to the metal.  To optimize for mobile, I had to directly
open up the buffers and perform matrix operations.  Cool stuff.''

The waitress brought us warm saki and sashimi, and we talked about our other
interviews, internships, and classes.  Another guy from Cornell started talking
about his boss at Palantir, and how'd they'd done acid together at work.

``That's terrifying,'' I said, thinking of Palantir's glossy black office in
Chelsea.  I thought about Chelsea Manning, alone on his laptop looking for some
sort of human contact, in an unbearably flat world, trying to act ``normal''
while talking with his boss about OCaml.

I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror after pissing.

We decided to go to the legal recreational marijuana shop, the first and only
one in the state. 

The cab driver knew exactly where we wanted to go, even before I gave him the
address.  I felt slightly ashamed by what I was doing, but the purchasing
experience exceptional.  Someone greeted us at the door and made us feel
comfortably, and the people behind the glass display cases seemed to share our
disbelief at the ease of the process.

After going to another restaurant recommended by the Taiwanese guy, we found a
park somewhere near our hotel.

We removed the pre-rolled joints from their plastic tubes, and passed around a
lighter.  By the time I finished my joint, I felt pretty high, but not paranoid
or dysphoric.  The other guys were stupidly high.

Saurabh stared at us with wide eyes.  ``Do you guys ever think that you might
not actually die?'' said Saurabh.  

The sober Taiwanese guy laughed manically and nervously.  I smiled and listened
to the night wind in the trees above.

``Like Amazon Web Services is a living thing?  And that if we work at Amazon our
code will become a part of it?  I think that will keep happening.''

``I feel you,'' I said.  ``But I think there's a long way to go.''  I thought
about servers in a dark Manhattan office, computing now.

The other Cornell guy was rocking back and forth.

``People who don't understand computers are going to have to have a hard time,''
he said.

``They're fucked,'' said Saurabh.

``I don't know,'' I said.

I knew that my interest in computers and programming could be traced back to my
childhood love for books about magic.  I had lain awake with tears in my eyes
begging to be blessed with magical powers.  I was interested in computers
insofar as the layers of abstraction allowed me to feel a sense of that, even
though I knew that the spirit living in the computer was something utterly
unmagical, dull, and abstract.  I respected that spirit but did not want
anything to do with it.  

We went to a very nice pizza place, where even I felt paranoid.  But we became
more jovial after eating, the extremely high guys exclaiming in confusion at the
overwhelming granular experience of chewing food.  Back at the hotel, I looked
up the typical offers for SE1's at Amazon.  Some were barely into the six
figures, but they all included at least a 40k starting bonus.

This would be my life.

When I arrived at the harbour, I walked for a moment.  The horizon seemed close,
and glassy bubbles welled up in the emerald Pacific Northwest water.  I thought
of the programmers at Microsoft working for the past twenty years in this
hydrated environment.  This would be a good place to write code.

It was bitterly cold back in Ithaca.

Before my first class, I went to the erg room for forty minutes of steady state.
I felt hopeful and clear-headed after, showering with my teammates.

When I got back to my locker, there was an email from my Amazon recruiter.  My
heart beat rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the
subject.  It was a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively. 

I threw my phone onto the stack of clothes in my locker and started to get
dressed.  I'm totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't
make sense.  Unbelievable.  I had written unit tests.

In my human-robotics interaction class, the young professor told us to find a
partner, and then gave us five minutes to build a tower out of spaghetti,
string, marshmellows, and tape.  It was a competition.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.  She looked tired
and effective.  She had a blemished face even though she seemed to be almost
thirty.  We instantly began to have difficulty regarding the planning of our
tower.  

I wanted to incorporate the string, but she didn't think it'd help.  At some
point we just started to build, and had a tower that seemed like it might be the
second tallest in the classroom, until it broke at the last second.

We joked about our tower uneasily, but it was obvious that we were secretly
blaming each other, and took these things seriously.

The professor told us that kindergarteners usually built taller towers than all
other groups besides engineers, because kindergarteners would instantly start
iterating, building tiny towers that failed, helping them gain an intuitive
understanding for the properties of spaghetti, marshmellows, and string.

I had some bad dreams during deep winter.  I dreamed of screaming at all of
people in my life, my parents, my rowing coach, the young women who I felt
should love me more.  

I felt jealous of the mice in the walls of my basement apartment.

On the weekends I forced myself to go out one night, usually half-heartedly
drinking a few beers with one of my injured rowing teammates, feeling sexually
frustrated.  Sometimes I heard the parties of my upstairs neighbors, other
seniors on the team, where they listed to old records and talked.  According to
my friend from Freshman year, these people were true `beautiful people`, and I
agreed.  I felt ill at ease at these events, which I supposed I was invited to.
After one of these events, late at night, I heard a male voice sobbing
violently, but I didn't go upstairs to figure out why.

Went to library to get book for Samuel

On Saturday and Sunday nights I tried to make myself happy by making a meal with
the frozen meat my grandparents had bought for me.  , but weekend nights I was exhausted, and would barely
be able to finish the dry food I made an a tallboy of Yuengling Lager before
falling asleep at my desk, trying to write C++.

It seemed that what I'd wanted most was all of the things that came along with
the happy, easy success of getting a name brand job right out of college.  I
felt disturbed by how much those names meant to me: Facebook, Google, Amazon,
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan.  Getting a job like that seemed the easiest way to
fix my life, even if I knew it probably wouldn't really fix my life.  But from
my parents persepctive, everyone else's perspective, it would.  I wanted it more
than I wanted the dismal, dark, self-delusional success that I may or may not
find pursing writing or game development in a nameless way.  I wanted it the way
I had wanted to hook up with hot, normal college students.  I couldn't figure
out why these companies didn't want me, why I had been so alone in coolege.  And
I was very close.  Google recruiter.  Who knew.

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

I resumed the familiar Cornell cycle of high hopes, not having enough time to do
anything, failure, exhaustion, and Internet.  My main goal of college had been
to get out of this cycle, to be able to do the things I wanted to do, but I was
realizing it was as natural as breathing.  Any progress I made was in the
residuals of failing to reach my goals, from the value of just showing up
unprepared and bullshitting, even though I was loathe to, because I wanted to be
beautiful, strong and good.

The Valentine's Day massacre, a 10k erg piece followed by a 3 mile run, was
always less awful than expected, possibly due to the feeling of running through
the hills of Ithaca in February.  It was relatively easy to get into a
consistent state of pain in the quiet cold, a gift of pain without abject
suffering. 

That evening, I went to dinner with my partner from robotics.  Her name was
Allison.  We'd chosen to work together.  

Right after Allison and I sat down, a small group of rowers, mostly Juniors,
came in with girls.  I nodded at them, over Allison's shoulder.  I was happy
with how civilized they seemed, how much more civilized they seemed than the
other undergraduates, who were usually disgustingly weak and

``Have you seen the brushes that they use on cows?'' said Allison.  We were
discussing a robot that would assist dishwashers, the first assignment.

``No,'' I said.

``In cow barns, they provide the cows with large, mounted, spinning brushes that
the cows can press up against.  They really love it for some reason, and it
increases milk production.''

``You mean we could create something like that, maybe controlled by an Arduino,
that you could press dishes against?''

``Yeah,'' said Allison.

We ate.  I was happy when Allison joined me in getting a third drink.

Allison wanted to know where I was working after graduation.

I knew that Allison currently worked at a supermarket because she'd provided
cardboard for a prototyping project.  Allsion 

``I'm not exactly sure yet,'' I said.  ``Probably Amazon, if I'm willing to move
to the west coast.''

``Cool,'' said Allison, nodding.  ``I think that's where I'm going to move,
too.''

``Oh yeah, you got an offer somewhere out there?''

``Yeah, at Google Research.''

``Awesome,'' I said.  ``Working on what?''

\plainfancybreak{12pt}{2}{* * *}

Even though it was dry season, I drove a group of rowers to a party up on North
campus.  Most of the older heavyweights and lightweight men were there, a long
with a lot of random underclassmen who just wanted a party.

``Why is he fighting here,'' I asked.  ``There's no way he can win.'' 

The Asian guy took a few steps through the snow towards Tom, raising his hands.

``You're a fucking pussy,'' said Tom quietly, smiling. 

The Asian guy swung at Tom, the second punch hitting above Tom's eye.

``You're so gay, Pat,'' said 

``No, I'm not,'' I said

Feeling comfortable with my sexuality was sort of like discovering a hidden room
in the basement of my childhood home.  The beautiful confident place I had found
with Lisa and Anna was a place I knew I could go back to.  My past worries were
gone, I didn't have to ``come to terms with my sexuality'', I didn't have to be
afraid or ashamed.  I was coming to realize that my sexuality was one of the
least problematic aspects of my personality.
 
Not all that great

I was having trouble pushing myself.  It used to be that a good EDM song would
come on, and I'd feel the cold adrenaline want to push more, in a sort of broken
away.  Something about the reality of the situation made me embrace it, even if
meant going to the bathroom between pieces, sitting on the toilet seeing sweat
roll off my legs, and my scared bright red face in the mirror.

The combination of the yelling, pain and sight of others failing around me would
make me expect that someone with authority would end this.

During my first fall on the Cornell rowing team, I had a constant sense that
all of my teammates were calling me ``faggot'' or ``pussy'' behind my back.  I
imagined that if I showed my ``true self'' their friendliness would turn into
open hate, like when you kill allied soldiers in a video game, and they start
attacking you and your crosshairs go from green to red.  

``Don't get frantic about the cold; if God didn't punish us, we would just
punish ourselves even more,'' yelled Coach Terry.  It felt like skiing weather

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach Terry.  ``You ever heard the story about the
chicken and the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon
and egg breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the
bacon and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says:
``The chicken worked hard to make this breakfast.  But the pig, he was
committed.'' I tried to shake the seashells out of my loafers so I could at
least wear them back to campus. 

Bounding box.  the parameters for death.

``About 300 megabytes on each level load,'' said Cristian.  ``Christ,'' I said.
Mentally I imagined 300 medium-length novels.  ``The player has to be able to
see themselves die, or they won't know why they died.''

I slept deeply from one to four in the afternoon and then went to practice,
which turned out to be a relaxing 3x30 minutes of steady state.  It was warm
enough to run outside, and it was still light out.

I felt lightheaded.  That night, as I felt the incredible release of the
beginning of spring break, I knew I was sick.  

I had pneumonia.  I emailed the coaches, saying it might be a few days before I
could practice.

I got as much food and beer as I could carry back from the 7/11.  I decided I'd
give myself a day or two to recover.  I started to drink and play Deus Ex.  

I did nothing but drink and play Deus Ex for almost three days.  My pneumonia
was pretty bad, requiring me to go to the bathroom to cough bile into the
toilet.  I felt guilty about not being at practice, but it was okay.  I felt
more guilty about not working on the game.  But I knew that experiencing Deus
Ex, the game of the year in 2000, was important for me.

I played very late into the night, basically sitting on my space heater.  At
night I would get so drunk that the display swam in front of me, and I felt that
the old graphics were impossibly beautiful.  In Deus Ex, when JC Denton drinks
wine or beer, or does drugs, the screen gets more and more distorted with every
drink.  Sometimes it was almost impossible to tell what I was doing, in the dark
underground areas of the game or stumbling around my basement apartment with a
beer, coughing in the bathroom.

It was one of the happiest times I had during college.

It was painful to be a loser in their presence.  

``All of my friends that I admire seem to hate themselves pretty regularly,''
said Samuel placidly.  ``It's something I've come to accept,'' he said after I
didn't respond.

``I don't want to hate myself, it's fucking stupid and I'm sick of it,'' I said.  

Samuel didn't respond.

``Maybe I should just accept the Amazon offer and move to Seattle,'' I said.
``It'll be okay.''

``No, you should move to New York, and do glamorous culture stuff,'' said
Samuel.

``I think when you look back on rowing it will be very indistinct for you.'' 

Maybe I should have quit two years ago.  I had never seriously considered the
idea before.

Surprisingly, there was no seat racing on Monday morning, and I kept my seat in
the boat.  But on Tuesday...

During early spring I was usally awoken a few minutes before my 5:50 AM alarm by
the sound of my teammates coming down the stairs and getting some breakfast.  I
had developed the habit of waking up around 4:30 AM to drink a Gatorade and eat
a peanut butter and jelly so I'd wake up hydrated and ready to pee, so there
wouldn't be any pressure on my bladder in the boat. 

``You're living life,''

I looked up at the hills above campus, knowing it might be the last time I rowed
in a serious way on Lake Cayuga.  Won by about a length of open water.  ``Yeah
'' 

I knew that despite the part of me that wanted to be like these warlike youth,
my equilibrium was being quietly manic on my computer, in the the place I'd
found myself in during spring break.  I cared more for the virtual text of any
given momment than I cared about winning or losing.  I had never really wanted
to exert myself like this, but of course I had been necessary to try.  I'd done
it to prove something to myself and others, and to some degree I'd be
successful, but now it was over and I still felt alone and unsuccessful.

I put on my rowing trou and a tank top, but on the way to the erg room the
heaviness in my throat won and I went to the bathroom.  A few lightweight
rowers were still there putting on sunscreen, so I went into one of the stalls.
Then I willed myself to start to crying heavily but silently, in a fully warm
and cathartic way.  

It was more bitter than I had hoped.  It was like many springs in middle school
and high school, 

``Come back to Donlon with us, we have some presents for you,'' said my mom. 

``Okay,'' I said.  

We made the long walk back to the dorms.  My grandfather said something about
how he remembered work seeming like a vacation after college, and that I could
start making real money now.

``I'm not so sure I'll be focusing on that, right after graduation,'' I said,
and immediately regretted it, thinking about him at my age, with a four year old
daughter.  He was silent.  My dad and I talked about my plans for the next
couple months.  I again had the feeling that my grandfather despised me, even if
he didn't know it himself.  I pushed the thought to the side, thoughts like that
weren't any good for a 23 year old.

Back at the dorm I sat around while my sisters changed.  I felt relaxed.

I opened presents from my aunt and great aunt first.  Both had given me \$100
checks.  I was surprised and happy.  My parents had given me new shoes.  They
would later send me an e-card for \$1000, saying they were proud of my hard
work.  

Finally I opened the present from my grandparents.  The card on the outside
contained a check for \$x000.  

``Thank you so much,'' I said, and started opening the actual present.  It was a
cheap blue plastic toolbox.  ``For your apartment,'' said Pop.  ''Open it.''

I opened up the toolbox.  There was a flimsy saw and light hammer.  A \$100 bill
was taped to the inside of the case.

``The best tool of all!'' said Pop loudly, reading the handwritten note attached
to the billfold.  I laughed.
