``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor,
enjoying the warm feeling after a workout.

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said.

A few days later, I flew to Seattle for an interview at Amazon.  I brought my
dog Allison, an unusually smart dachshund that I've owned since I was 20.  I
love her.  

I remember feeling happy and relaxed.  It was warm enough to sit outside at the
pizza place recommended by the front desk.   I drank a Hot Toddy and did some
coding problems until it became dark.  

My phone flashed.

``I'd love to graduate in May 2018 with only six semesters on campus,'' said
Samuel.  I put my programming notebook away.

``I'm considering taking a fifth class to increase the chances of this
happening.  How do you feel about writing a few papers, nothing over ten pages,
and some blog posts?  For â€¦ 1k?  Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.
Do you want to pursue this at all?'' 

``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it.

The next morning, I walked to the interview with Allison.  It felt like a spring
morning.  Amazon employees are allowed to bring their dogs to work, and I had
confirmed that I could bring Allison.

It was supposed to be a collaborative coding exercise.  About thirty of us were
shown into a large conference room, split into groups of four, and given
laptops.  

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``We'll be pulling you out individually for about twenty minutes to discuss your
part of the problem.  Feel free to ask us any questions.'' I flagged down one of
the 

Something concise about: feeling of rage, getting high with other interviewees, jog.

``You did acid with your boss at Palantir?  That's terrifying.''

It was my last semester of college, and more importantly, my last semester of
rowing, and I intended to try.  Before my first class, I went to the erg room
for forty minutes of steady state. 

After, I showered with my teammates, feeling clear and hopeful.  When I got back
to my locker, there was a letter from my Amazon recruiter.  My heart beat
rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the subject.  It
was a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively.  I read through the
email, thoroughly in disbelief.

I threw my phone onto the stack of clothes in my locker and started to get
dressed.  I'm totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't
make sense.  Unbelievable.

I started to feel the increasingly familiar feeling of annoyance at having so
thoroughly imagined my future life and priorities around a company that then
rejected me for reasons I only half understood.

  

Birthday.

Taughannock row and pneumonia.

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach.  ``You ever heard the story about the chicken and
the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon and egg
breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the bacon
and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says: ``The
chicken worked hard to make this breakfast.  But the pig, he was committed.'' I
tried to shake the seashells out of my loafers so I could at least wear them
back to campus.  Bounding box.  the parameters for death.  ``About 300 megabytes
on each level load,'' said Cristian.  ``Christ,'' I said.  Mentally I imagined 300
medium-length novels.  ``The player has to be able to see themselves die, or
they won't know why they died.'' 

	Spitting.  It was one of the happiest times I had during college.
	

It was painful to be a loser in their presence.  

I looked up at the hills above campus, and noted the light and clouds and
glassiness of the water.  I knew it might be the last time I rowed in a serious
way on Lake Cayuga.  Won by about a length of open water.  ``Yeah Steady,'' False
spring, writing paper, end of rowing, sunscreen.
