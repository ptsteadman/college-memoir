``I'm interested in spending a semester or two at like a state school,'' said
Samuel, a few days after Christmas.  ``Do you think I'd be able to get credits?
I don't know if this makes sense.''

``Seems like a good idea to me,'' I said.  I was lying on my bedroom floor,
enjoying the warm feeling after a workout.

``I can't really articulate why I want to go to state school while still
graduating from Yale.   Maybe it's intuitive, the reasoning behind it.'' 

``No, I get it,'' I said.

A few days later, I flew to Seattle with my dog Allison in her purse bag.
Allison is an unusually smart dachshund that I've owned since I was 20.  I love
her.  

I had a software engineering interview at Amazon the next day.  I felt happy and
relaxed.  It was warm enough to sit outside and drink a Hot Toddy while I did
some coding problems. 

My phone flashed.

``I'm considering taking a fifth class to increase the chances graduating in May
2018 with only six semesters on campus,'' said Samuel.  I put my notebook away.

``How do you feel about writing a few papers, nothing over ten pages,
and some blog posts?  For â€¦ 1k?  Basically, you'd be taking the class for me.
Do you want to pursue this at all?'' 

``Sure,'' I said, knowing I'd regret it.

Amazon employees are allowed to bring dogs to work, and I had confirmed that I
could bring Allison to the interview.  I walked to the interview site with
her, on a confusingly spring-like morning. 

About thirty of us were shown into a large conference room, split into groups of
four, and given laptops.  

``You have until 3pm to finish your implementation,'' said the head interviewer.
``We'll be pulling you out individually for about twenty minutes to discuss your
part of the problem.  Feel free to ask us any questions.'' I flagged down one of

Something concise about: feeling of rage, getting high with other interviewees, jog.

``You did acid with your boss at Palantir?  That's terrifying.''

It was my last semester of college, and more importantly, my last semester of
rowing, and I intended to try.  Before my first class, I went to the erg room
for forty minutes of steady state. 

After, I showered with my teammates, feeling clear and hopeful.  When I got back
to my locker, there was a letter from my Amazon recruiter.  My heart beat
rapidly and my throat constricted.  "Thanks From Amazon" was the subject.  It
was a rejection.  What the hell, I thought percussively.  I read through the
email, thoroughly in disbelief.

I threw my phone onto the stack of clothes in my locker and started to get
dressed.  I'm totally willing to be in denial about this, I thought.  It doesn't
make sense.  Unbelievable.

On the first day of my robotics class, the young professor told us to find a
partner, and we were given five minutes to build the tallest tower we could
using only spaghetti, string, paper, and tape.

My partner was one of the few non-Asian women in the class.

I stuck one of my hands down my unisuit and underneath my balls.  ``You guys
have to commit,'' yelled Coach.  ``You ever heard the story about the chicken and
the pig?'' ``No,'' said the coxswain.  ``A man makes his son a bacon and egg
breakfast.  The father asks his kid, what's the difference between the bacon
and the eggs?  The kid is like what, I don't know, and the father says: ``The
