Of course, the best way to empathise with women is to be one. Estrogen and
anti-androgens are readily available on the internet and (usually) from your
local doctor. It takes between six to twelve months if you want to wait for
hormones to work their magic, but if you’re somewhere safe you can start right
away and many do. Having boobs and feeling cute is the best feeling, and while
it’s a hard path to tread you’ll come out the other side an incredible person.
